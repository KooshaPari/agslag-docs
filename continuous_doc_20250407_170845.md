# Continuous Documentation Log - 2025-04-07 17:08:45 PDT

## Session Start

This file marks the initiation of **Continuous Documentation Mode**.

---

## Purpose

In this mode, every significant step, decision, or action taken during the development or analysis process will be **persistently documented** in a new, timestamped markdown file.

This ensures a **comprehensive, chronological record** of the entire workflow, including:

- Contextual summaries of the environment and files
- Reasoning behind each decision
- Details of commands executed
- Code changes with explanations
- Architectural insights
- Any encountered issues and resolutions

---

## File Naming Convention

Each documentation file is named as:

```
continuous_doc_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md
```

where the timestamp corresponds to the moment the file was created.

---

## Next Steps

As I proceed, I will generate new documentation files at each key step or interval, capturing the full context and rationale.

This initial file serves as the **starting point** of the continuous documentation session.
