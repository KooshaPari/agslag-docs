# MCP Multi-Agent Quality Assurance Protocols

This document outlines the standard protocols for ensuring application quality, focusing on accessibility and security testing within the MCP multi-agent development environment. It complements the `project_management_framework.md` and `team_coordination_protocols.md`.

## 1. Quality Assurance Philosophy

*   **Goal:** To proactively identify and address issues related to functionality, usability, accessibility, security, and performance throughout the development lifecycle.
*   **Approach:** Integrate automated and manual testing practices, leveraging specialized QA agents and tools where appropriate. Foster a shared responsibility for quality across all development roles.

## 2. Functional & Regression Testing

*(This section can be expanded later based on existing QA Agent roles defined in `organizational_structure.md`, detailing test plan creation, execution, bug tracking, etc.)*

## 3. Accessibility Testing (A11y)

Ensuring applications are usable by people with diverse abilities is crucial.

### a. Tools & Standards
*   **Primary Tools:**
    *   **axe DevTools:** Browser extension and related libraries for automated accessibility scanning during development and testing.
    *   **Lighthouse:** Integrated into browser developer tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools) for auditing accessibility, performance, PWA, and SEO.
*   **Standards:** Adherence to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA is the target standard.

### b. Process & Responsibilities
*   **Frontend Development Agents:**
    *   Responsible for writing semantic HTML, using appropriate ARIA attributes where necessary, and ensuring keyboard navigability during component development.
    *   Should run axe DevTools scans locally during development to catch issues early.
*   **UI/UX Design Agents:**
    *   Responsible for designing accessible interfaces, considering color contrast, focus indicators, logical content flow, and providing text alternatives for non-text content.
*   **QA Agents:**
    *   Responsible for performing comprehensive accessibility testing as part of the test plan for new features or significant UI changes.
    *   Execute automated scans using axe and Lighthouse during regression testing or dedicated A11y test passes.
    *   Perform manual testing, including keyboard navigation checks, screen reader testing (simulated or actual), and zoom testing.
    *   Report accessibility issues using the standard bug tracking process, tagging them appropriately (e.g., `A11y`, `WCAG`).
*   **Integration Point:** Accessibility checks (automated scans and key manual checks) should be part of the Pull Request (PR) review process and pre-deployment checklists.

### c. Reporting
*   Automated tool reports (axe, Lighthouse) should be attached to relevant QA tasks or PRs.
*   Manual testing findings should be documented clearly in bug reports, referencing specific WCAG criteria where applicable.
*   Periodic A11y audit reports may be generated by QA Agents for overall assessment.

## 4. Security Testing

Proactively identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities is essential.

### a. Tools & Standards
*   **Primary Tools:**
    *   **Snyk:** Used for identifying vulnerabilities in application code, open-source dependencies, and container images.
    *   **OWASP ZAP / Burp Suite (Optional/Manual):** For more in-depth penetration testing by specialized security agents or human testers.
*   **Standards:** Adherence to OWASP Top 10 and other relevant security best practices (e.g., secure coding guidelines, dependency management).

### b. Process & Responsibilities
*   **All Development Agents (Frontend/Backend):**
    *   Responsible for writing secure code, following best practices for input validation, output encoding, authentication, authorization, and error handling.
    *   Should be aware of common vulnerabilities related to their domain (e.g., XSS, CSRF for frontend; SQL Injection, insecure deserialization for backend).
*   **DevOps / Security Agents:**
    *   Responsible for integrating automated security scanning tools (like Snyk) into the CI/CD pipeline.
    *   Configure Snyk (or similar) to scan code repositories, dependencies, and container images regularly (e.g., on commit, nightly builds, pre-deployment).
    *   Triage reported vulnerabilities based on severity (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low).
    *   Manage infrastructure security (firewalls, access controls, secrets management).
*   **QA Agents:**
    *   Include basic security checks in test plans (e.g., testing input validation, checking for basic injection flaws, verifying access controls).
    *   Verify fixes for security vulnerabilities reported by automated tools or manual testing.
*   **Integration Point:**
    *   CI/CD pipeline should fail builds if critical/high severity vulnerabilities are detected by Snyk scans (configurable threshold).
    *   Security vulnerabilities identified should be tracked as high-priority bugs in the issue tracking system.
    *   Security reviews may be part of the PR process for sensitive code changes.

### c. Reporting
*   Snyk scan reports should be accessible to development and security teams, integrated with the CI/CD pipeline results.
*   Critical/High vulnerabilities trigger immediate alerts/notifications to relevant leads/agents.
*   Vulnerabilities are tracked as bugs, including severity, affected component, and remediation status.
*   Periodic security audit reports may be generated.
