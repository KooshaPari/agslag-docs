# Documentation Development Work Plan

## 1. Objective
To collaboratively refine, detail, and expand the documentation for the AI-Powered Digital Product Development Platform, ensuring accuracy, clarity, and completeness for both human developers and AI agents.

## 2. Scope
This plan covers the development and refinement of all documentation files located within the `/Users/kooshapari/temp-PRODVERCEL/mcp_official-2/Documentation Plan for Large Scale Agent Development/` directory, including the `llm_context` subdirectory, as outlined in `llm_context/00_context_index.md`.

## 3. Methodology
- **Iterative Refinement:** Documentation will be developed iteratively, potentially in parallel by different agents based on expertise.
- **Agent Assignment:** Specific sections or documents may be assigned to agents with relevant capabilities (e.g., an agent familiar with the `team-communications` server refines `mcp_agent_communication.md`).
- **Review Process:** A review step (potentially involving another agent or human oversight) should be incorporated before finalizing major sections.

## 4. File Locking Strategy
To prevent conflicts when multiple agents might work on documentation:
- **Tools:** Utilize the `team-communications` MCP server tools: `acquire_file_lock`, `release_file_lock`, `check_file_lock`.
- **Acquire Before Edit:** An agent **MUST** successfully acquire a lock using `acquire_file_lock` before making any modifications to a file. The `agent_id` used must be unique and persistent for the agent.
- **Check Before Acquire:** Before attempting to acquire, agents *should* ideally use `check_file_lock` to see if a file is already locked.
- **Release After Save:** Locks **MUST** be released using `release_file_lock` immediately after changes are successfully saved using `write_to_file` or `replace_in_file`.
- **Conflict Handling:**
    - If `acquire_file_lock` fails because the file is locked by another agent, the requesting agent should use `send_message` to contact the lock-holding agent to coordinate.
    - If the lock-holding agent is unresponsive (determined via `check_agent_responsiveness` or lack of communication) or has crashed, manual intervention (requesting the user to clear the lock from `db.json`) is required. Stale locks should not block progress indefinitely.

## 5. Task Breakdown (Initial High-Level)
This plan will be broken down into specific tasks, tracked potentially using the `mcp-taskmanager` or another designated system. Example tasks include:

*   **Task DWP-1:** Refine Core MCP Reference (`llm_context/01_mcp_framework/01_core_mcp_reference.md`) - *Assignee: TBD (MCP Core Expert)*
*   **Task DWP-2:** Detail MCP Tool Reference (`llm_context/01_mcp_framework/02_mcp_tool_reference.md`) - *Assignee: TBD (Tooling Expert)*
*   **Task DWP-3:** Elaborate Agent Lifecycle (`llm_context/01_mcp_framework/03_agent_lifecycle.md`) - *Assignee: TBD (Orchestration Expert)*
*   **Task DWP-4:** Detail Gemini API Integration (`llm_context/02_external_apis/01_gemini_api_integration.md`) - *Assignee: TBD (API Integration Expert)*
*   **Task DWP-5:** Document Third-Party Services (`llm_context/03_third_party_services/*`) - *Assignee: TBD*
*   **Task DWP-6:** Enhance Software Development Guides (`llm_context/04_software_development/*`) - *Assignee: TBD (SWE Expert)*
*   **Task DWP-7:** Refine Development Process Docs (`llm_context/05_development_process/*`) - *Assignee: TBD (Process Expert)*
*   **Task DWP-8:** Detail QA Strategy (`llm_context/06_quality_assurance/*`) - *Assignee: TBD (QA Expert)*
*   **Task DWP-9:** Update Top-Level Documents (`*.md` in root) - *Assignee: TBD (Lead/Architect)*

*(Note: Specific task creation and assignment will follow based on agent availability and specialization.)*

## 6. Coordination & Communication
- **Primary Channel:** Use the `team-communications` MCP server.
- **Threads:** Create specific threads using `create_thread` for discussing individual documents or cross-cutting concerns.
- **Status Updates:** Agents should report status using `report_status` periodically or upon task completion/blockers.
- **Agent Discovery:** Use `find_agents` to identify agents with specific capabilities for task assignment or consultation.

## 7. Deliverables
- Updated and refined markdown documentation files within the specified scope.
- Consistent application of the file locking strategy.

## 8. Tracking
Progress on the sub-tasks derived from this plan will be tracked using the `mcp-taskmanager` system (or as directed). This plan itself corresponds to `task-5` of request `req-1`.
