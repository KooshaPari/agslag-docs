# Product Management Workflow

## Introduction

This document describes the core workflow and responsibilities of the Product Management team. Product Managers act as the bridge between business strategy, user needs, and technical execution, guiding the product from conception through launch and iteration.

## Key Responsibilities & Stages

Product Management is involved throughout the [Digital Product Development Lifecycle](./digital_product_lifecycle.md). Key stages and activities include:

        *   Analyzing sales data and customer feedback (from Sales, Support) to identify pain points/opportunities.
        *   Facilitating brainstorming and ideation sessions (e.g., using Miro, FigJam).
        *   Defining product vision, mission, and strategic goals (often documented in Confluence, Product Briefs).
        *   Developing initial business cases, including potential ROI and market sizing.
        *   Creating high-level, theme-based roadmaps (e.g., using Aha!, Productboard, Jira Roadmaps).

## Integration

Product Management acts as a central hub, interacting with nearly all other functions as outlined in the [Digital Product Development Lifecycle](./digital_product_lifecycle.md). They ensure alignment between the product vision, user needs, business goals, and the execution details handled by [UI/UX Design](./ui_ux_design_workflow.md), Engineering ([Software Engineering Process Diagram](./software_engineering_process_diagram.md)), [Marketing](./marketing_product_workflow.md), [Sales](./sales_product_workflow.md), [Support](./customer_support_workflow.md), [DevOps](./devops_workflow.md), and other teams.
