# MCP Servers Analysis

This directory contains detailed reports on various Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that can be integrated into the AGSLAG system. These reports analyze the capabilities, integration points, and potential use cases for each MCP server.

## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that enables AI models to securely interact with local and remote resources through standardized server implementations. MCP servers extend AI capabilities by providing access to:

- File systems
- Databases
- APIs
- Code execution environments
- Knowledge bases
- And other contextual services

## Categories of MCP Servers

The reports are organized into the following categories:

1. **Database MCP Servers** - Servers that provide access to various database systems
2. **File System MCP Servers** - Servers that provide access to file systems
3. **API Integration MCP Servers** - Servers that provide access to external APIs
4. **Development Tool MCP Servers** - Servers that provide access to development tools
5. **Specialized Domain MCP Servers** - Servers that provide access to specialized domains

## Reports

Each report provides:

- Overview of the MCP server
- Key features and capabilities
- Technical architecture
- Integration points with AGSLAG
- Configuration requirements
- Potential use cases
- Implementation considerations

## Integration Strategy

For guidance on how to integrate these MCP servers into the AGSLAG system, refer to the [MCP Integration Strategy](./integration-strategy.md) document.

## Getting Started

To get started with MCP servers:

1. Review the reports in this directory to identify the MCP servers that meet your needs
2. Follow the configuration instructions in each report
3. Use the integration examples to incorporate the MCP servers into your AGSLAG system
4. Test the integration to ensure it works as expected
