# External Tooling Report

## Overview
This report summarizes the findings from reviewing external tooling available in `agslag/external-tooling` and `G:\Cline\Cline\MCP`.

## Findings from `agslag/external-tooling`
1. `agent-analysis`:
   - A comprehensive toolkit for analyzing Software Engineering (SWE) agents.
   - Focuses on performance evaluation, feature analysis, and benchmarking.
   - Includes core analysis modules and Jupyter notebooks for interactive analysis.
   - Uses Poetry for dependency management.

2. `augment-swebench-agent`:
   - Enhances the SWE-bench agent using Claude Sonnet 3.7 and OpenAI's o1 models.
   - Features include bash command execution, file viewing and editing, and sequential thinking.
   - Includes integration with Anthropic's Claude for the core agent and OpenAI models for ensembling.
   - Provides command approval management and a majority vote ensembler.

## Findings from `G:\Cline\Cline\MCP`
- Contains numerous MCP server implementations for various tools and services.
- Examples include MCP servers for:
  - Ableton Live
  - Claude Code
  - Firebase
  - GitHub
  - Postman
  - SQL Analyzer
  - Website Downloader
  - Many more

## Insights and Recommendations
1. Incorporate analysis and benchmarking techniques from `agent-analysis` to evaluate our SWE agents.
2. Adopt features from `augment-swebench-agent`, such as multi-model ensembling and improved command execution.
3. Utilize the diverse MCP servers available in `G:\Cline\Cline\MCP` to integrate various tools and services into our project.
4. Consider using Poetry for dependency management, as seen in `agent-analysis`, to simplify our project's dependency handling.

By leveraging these external tools and MCP servers, we can enhance our project's capabilities in analyzing and improving SWE agents, as well as integrating various tools and services.
