# Report: The day I taught AI to think like a Senior Developer (Namanyay Goel)

---

## Core Problem

- Current AI coding tools **do not truly understand codebases**.
- They act as **sophisticated autocomplete** rather than intelligent assistants.
- They **lack a mental model** of the project, leading to repeated mistakes, misplaced files, and incorrect patterns.

---

## Key Insights

- **Codebases have semantic structure**:
  - Folder hierarchy reflects conceptual relationships.
  - Not all code is equally important; boilerplate vs. core logic.
- AI tools **fail to grasp these semantics**, operating on flat, context-limited views.

---

## Breakthrough Approach

- **Ranked Recursive Summarization (RRS)**:
  - Recursively summarize files and folders.
  - Rank chunks by importance before summarizing.
  - Builds a **hierarchical understanding** of the codebase.
- **Prismatic RRS (PRRS)**:
  - Summarize through **multiple conceptual lenses** (architecture, data flow, security).
  - Produces a **multi-faceted mental model** akin to a senior developer's understanding.

---

## Impact

- AI can:
  - Place files logically.
  - Follow existing patterns.
  - Extend abstractions correctly.
  - Reuse code appropriately.
- Enables:
  - Visibility into technical debt.
  - Easier security audits.
  - Faster onboarding.
  - Junior devs to work with senior-level insight.

---

## Broader Implications

- AI with true codebase understanding **augments developer capabilities**.
- Could **reduce the value of mid-level coding skills** focused on translation rather than architecture.
- Shifts AI from **autocomplete** to **context-aware collaborator**.

---

## Practical Recommendations

- Even without this tool, teams can:
  - Manually summarize key parts of their codebase.
  - Use AI to refine these summaries.
  - Create documentation from multiple perspectives.
  - Feed these into AI prompts for better results.

---

## Conclusion

- The future of AI coding tools lies in **deep, multi-perspective understanding** of codebases.
- This will **transform AI from a code generator to a true development partner**.
- Developers and companies embracing this will gain a **sustainable advantage**.
