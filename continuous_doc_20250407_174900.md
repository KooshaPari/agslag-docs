## Summary

**LASER (LAyer-SElective Rank reduction)** is a novel method to **simultaneously improve LLM task performance and reduce model size** **without any additional training**.

### Motivation

- LLMs are often **over-parameterized**, leading to inefficiencies.
- Traditional pruning reduces size but can harm performance.
- Goal: **Optimize LLMs** without retraining or sacrificing accuracy.

### Method: LASER

- Uses **singular value decomposition (SVD)** to analyze weight matrices.
- **Selectively reduces higher-order components** in:
  - **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) layers**
  - **Attention layers**
- Preserves essential components, removes redundancies.
- No additional training or fine-tuning required.

### Results

- **Improved accuracy** on NLP reasoning benchmarks.
- **Reduced model size** and computational cost.
- Better handling of **rare or nuanced data**.
- Increased **robustness and factuality**.
- Achieved **without any extra training**.

## Relevance to Our Project

- Can be applied to existing LLMs to:
  - **Reduce size and inference cost**.
  - **Improve accuracy and robustness**.
  - Enable **resource-constrained deployments** (edge devices, mobile).
- Complements context extension methods (SelfExtend, InfLLM).
- Useful for **scalable, efficient multi-agent systems**.

## Next Steps

- Explore applying LASER to our LLMs.
- Evaluate impact on model size, speed, and accuracy.
- Combine with other techniques for efficient, scalable LLM orchestration.
