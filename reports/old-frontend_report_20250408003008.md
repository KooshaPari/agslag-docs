# Old Frontend (MCP Dashboard Next) Analysis Report (2025-04-08)

This report provides an analysis of the `old-frontend` project (identified as `mcp-dashboard-next` in its `package.json`) based on its file structure, key source files, and configuration.

## 1. General Information

**Purpose:** This project is a web-based frontend application, likely serving as a dashboard or user interface for interacting with the Jarvis AI agent system and potentially the `mcp-server` orchestration layer.

**Key Features:**

*   **Framework:** Built using Next.js 15 (with Turbopack enabled for development) and React 19. It utilizes the Next.js App Router paradigm.
*   **UI Components:** Leverages Radix UI primitives and likely shadcn/ui components (implied by `components.json`, `tailwind.config.js`, `src/components/ui/`) for building the user interface. Uses Tailwind CSS for styling.
*   **Real-time Communication:** Integrates `socket.io-client` to connect to a WebSocket server (presumably the one provided by `mcp-server` or `jarvis-swe-agent`) for real-time updates and interactions.
*   **Data Fetching & State:** Uses `@tanstack/react-query` for server state management and data fetching, and Zustand for client-side state management.
*   **Visualizations:** Includes libraries for various visualizations:
    *   Charts: `chart.js`, `react-chartjs-2`, `recharts`
    *   Graphs: `react-force-graph`, `react-force-graph-3d` (potentially for agent networks or knowledge graphs)
    *   Diagrams: `mermaid`
*   **Authentication:** Integrates Firebase Authentication (`firebase`, `FirebaseAuthContext`).
*   **AI/LLM Integration:** Includes Google Genkit dependencies, suggesting it might interact directly with Genkit or display information related to Genkit-managed processes from the backend.
*   **Jarvis Integration:** Contains specific components and context (`JarvisProvider`, `src/components/jarvis/`) tailored for interacting with the Jarvis agent system.
*   **Markdown & Code Rendering:** Uses `react-markdown`, `remark-gfm`, `rehype-katex`, `remark-math`, and `react-syntax-highlighter` to display formatted text and code, likely for agent messages or documentation.

**Architecture:**

*   **Framework:** Next.js App Router.
*   **Language:** TypeScript.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS.
*   **State Management:** Zustand (client), React Query (server).
*   **UI Library:** Radix UI / shadcn/ui.
*   **Context Providers:** Uses React Context API (`ClientProviders.tsx`) to manage global state/services like Authentication (`FirebaseAuthProvider`), App state (`AppProvider`), and Jarvis interactions (`JarvisProvider`).
*   **API Client:** Likely uses `axios` and custom API client logic (`src/lib/api-client.ts`, `src/lib/jarvis-api.ts`) to communicate with backend APIs.
*   **Real-time:** Connects via `socket.io-client` (`src/lib/websocket.ts`).

## 2. Potential Improvements & Areas for Investigation

*   **"Old" Designation:** The directory name `old-frontend` suggests this might be a legacy or deprecated version. Clarify its current status and if a newer frontend exists.
*   **Routing Issues:** The presence of multiple `ROUTING_FIX` markdown files and scripts (`fix-router.js`, `verify-app-router.js`) indicates past or ongoing challenges with Next.js App Router implementation. A review of the current routing setup might be needed.
*   **Build/Export Scripts:** Numerous custom scripts related to building, exporting static pages, and adding static props (`build-skip-jarvis.js`, `export-static-pages.js`, `add-static-props.js`) suggest potential complexities or workarounds in the build process. Simplify or document these if possible.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for API calls, WebSocket communication, and component rendering. Consider using error boundaries.
*   **State Management Complexity:** Using both Zustand and React Query is common, but ensure clear separation of concerns between client and server state. Review the usage within `AppProvider` and `JarvisProvider`.
*   **Performance:** Analyze frontend performance, especially with complex visualizations (force graphs, charts) and real-time updates. Optimize rendering and data fetching. Consider Next.js features like Server Components where applicable.
*   **Testing:** The `package.json` lacks specific testing scripts beyond linting and route testing. Implementing component and end-to-end tests would improve reliability.
*   **Genkit Integration:** Clarify how Genkit is used on the frontend. Is it directly calling Genkit flows, or just interacting with a backend that uses Genkit?
*   **Code Consistency & Linting:** Ensure consistent code style and address any existing ESLint warnings/errors (as indicated by the errors reported after the previous step).
*   **Dependency Review:** Check for unused or outdated dependencies.
