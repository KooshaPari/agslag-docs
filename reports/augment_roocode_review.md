# Augment Context Engine and RooCode API Review

---

## 1. Augment Context Engine

The Augment agent isolates and manages context through a combination of containerization, explicit prompt construction, and workspace abstractions.

### Context Isolation

- Each problem is assigned a **dedicated workspace directory**:  
  `workspace_base_path / problem_id / rollout_{idx}`  
  This ensures **contextual separation** for each problem instance.

- The agent runs inside a **dedicated Docker container** per problem, started via `setup_workspace()`.  
  This isolates dependencies, environment variables, and filesystem state.

### Context Passing

- The problem statement and workspace path are **explicitly passed** to the agent via CLI arguments:
  - `--workspace` (path to the code snapshot)
  - `--problem-statement` (task description)
  - `--docker-container-id` and `--use-container-workspace` (container context)

- These are used to **format an initial instruction prompt** embedding:
  - The workspace location
  - The problem description

### Context Processing

- The agent initializes:
  - An **LLM client** (Anthropic Claude 3 Sonnet)
  - A **WorkspaceManager** abstraction aware of container paths
  - An **Agent** object combining these with logging and console interfaces

- The agent's reasoning is **anchored in the combined context**:
  - Workspace state
  - Problem description
  - Container environment

- After execution, the agent generates a **patch** representing its code changes, which is then evaluated in the same context.

## 2. RooCode Gemini API Integration

- The codebase **does not contain direct Gemini API calls** or SDK usage.
- Instead, Gemini is **configured as a capability provider** in `agslag/config/hub-spoke-config.json`:
  ```json
  "gemini": {
    "capabilities": ["communication", "collaboration", "knowledge_proxy"]
  }
  ```
- This suggests Gemini is **abstracted behind a capability layer** or **handled externally**.
- No evidence of prompt routing or API key management for Gemini was found.

## 3. RooCode Prompt Improvement Tools

- The `agslag/prompt-engineering/` directory contains **extensive documentation** but **no executable code**.
- The documentation outlines a **comprehensive framework** for:
  - **Continuous prompt improvement cycles**
  - **Error detection, classification, and recovery**
  - **Multi-agent and multi-MCP orchestration**
  - **Knowledge sharing and continuous learning**
  - **Best practices for prompt design and refinement**

- Key focus areas include:
  - **Measurement and KPIs** for prompt effectiveness
  - **Analysis techniques** for prompt failures
  - **Improvement strategies** and validation methods
  - **Standardization and knowledge sharing**

---

## Summary

- The **Augment context engine** uses containerized, per-problem workspaces and explicit prompt construction to manage context effectively.
- **RooCode's Gemini integration** is configured but lacks direct implementation in this codebase.
- **Prompt improvement** is well-documented as a process framework but lacks dedicated tooling here.
