-## 1. Summary of the Article
+## Overview

-Shawn Lewis, CTO of Weights & Biases (W&B), developed an autonomous AI programming agent that achieved a state-of-the-art 64.6% resolution rate on the SWE-Bench-Verified benchmark. This surpasses previous OpenAI o1-based agents and was accomplished by leveraging W&B’s Weave toolkit, novel prompting strategies, and new frameworks.
+Shawn Lewis (CTO of Weights & Biases) built a state-of-the-art SWE-Bench-Verified agent using OpenAI o1 and their Weave toolkit. Key strategies include:

+- Using o1 with high reasoning mode
+- Memory compression with GPT-4o
+- Custom Python code editing tools
+- Auto-commands after edits
+- Parallel rollouts with cross-checking
+- Extensive evals and prompt engineering

  -## 2. Strategies and Techniques Employed
  +## Key Strategies to Incorporate
  -### Model and Prompting
  -- **OpenAI o1 with `reasoning_mode=high`**: Used for all agent logic and editing, enabling deep reasoning.
  -- **Outcome-Oriented Prompting**: Clear, explicit stopping conditions ensure the agent only finishes when the problem is truly solved.
  -- **Detailed Instructions**: The prompt includes granular, hard-earned requirements (e.g., test script behaviors), which o1 reliably follows.
  -- **Memory Compression**: A GPT-4o-based component compresses the agent’s step history to fit within context limits.
  -- **Handling Temporal Confusion**: Auto-commands execute after every edit to reduce reliance on the agent’s understanding of event order.
  +### 1. **Use o1 with High Reasoning Mode**
  -### Architecture
  -- **Parallel Rollouts with Cross-Check**: Five parallel agent rollouts are generated, then a novel cross-checking step algorithmically selects the best one using o1 as a tie-breaker.
  -- **Custom Python Code Editor Toolset**: Designed to optimize context usage and editing efficiency.
  -- **Auto-Commands**: Registered commands that run automatically post-edit, improving reliability and reducing prompt complexity.
  +- Prioritize models like o1 that excel at step-by-step reasoning.
  +- Set reasoning mode to high for all agent steps and editing logic.
  -### Tooling
  -- **W&B Weave**: Used extensively for experiment tracking, prompt management, and evaluation. Enabled running 977 evals to optimize the agent.
  -- **Eval Studio**: A visualization and analysis tool built atop Weave data, providing insights into model performance and failure cases.
  -- **Phaseshift Framework**: A new TypeScript-based framework for composing agents, tightly integrated with Weave for versioning and diffing of agent components.
  +### 2. **Memory Compression**
  +- Use a GPT-4o-based component to summarize and compress agent history.
  +- Feed compressed memory back into prompts to maintain context efficiently.
- +### 3. **Custom Code Editing Tools**
- +- Build or integrate tools specialized for Python code editing.
  +- Optimize for context window usage and precise diffs.
- +### 4. **Auto-Commands After Edits**
- +- Register commands that run automatically after each code edit.
  +- Examples: run tests, lint code, update plan, or re-evaluate.

  +### 5. **Parallel Rollouts with Cross-Check**
- +- Run multiple agent rollouts in parallel (e.g., 5).
  +- Use a cross-check step to select the best rollout, possibly with another LLM call.
- +### 6. **Outcome-Oriented Prompting**
- +- Define clear stopping conditions in prompts.
  +- Emphasize what the agent must verify before calling a task done.
- +### 7. **Detailed, Explicit Instructions**
- +- Add explicit, detailed instructions to prompts.
  +- o1 respects detailed prompts better than previous models.
- +### 8. **Reduce Time-Ordering Confusion**
- +- Use auto-commands to reduce reliance on the agent's temporal reasoning.
  +- Consider prompt instructions to review prior steps sequentially.
- +### 9. **Extensive Evals and Iteration**
- +- Use Weave or similar tools to run hundreds of evals.
  +- Analyze failures and refine prompts, tools, and workflows iteratively.

  -## 3. How This Can Be Applied to Your Project
  +## How to Integrate into Jarvis
  -### a) Autonomous Agent Design
  -- **Adopt Outcome-Oriented Prompting**: Define explicit, verifiable stopping conditions for your agents.
  -- **Use High-Reasoning Models**: Leverage models like o1 with reasoning mode enabled for complex, multi-step tasks.
  -- **Incorporate Memory Compression**: Use a summarization model (e.g., GPT-4o) to maintain relevant context over long agent sessions.
  +- **Adopt o1 or similar models** with high reasoning mode for core agent steps.
  +- **Implement memory compression** using GPT-4o or similar.
  +- **Develop custom code editing tools** optimized for your language(s).
  +- **Add auto-commands** after edits (e.g., run tests, re-evaluate).
  +- **Enable parallel rollouts** and implement a cross-check selection step.
  +- **Refine prompts** to be explicit, outcome-oriented, and detailed.
  +- **Use eval frameworks** (like Weave) to iterate and improve.
  -### b) Improving Reliability
  -- **Implement Auto-Commands**: Automate routine checks or environment resets after each agent action.
  -- **Parallel Rollouts with Cross-Validation**: Run multiple agent attempts in parallel and select the best via automated cross-checking.

  -### c) Tooling and Experimentation
  -- **Integrate with Weave or Similar Tracking**: Use experiment tracking to iterate on prompts, agent logic, and tool effectiveness.
  -- **Develop Visualization Dashboards**: Build or adopt tools like Eval Studio to analyze agent behavior and guide improvements.
  -- **Version Control for Agents**: Use frameworks like Phaseshift or similar to manage and diff agent versions.
  +## Expected Benefits
  -### d) Potential Integration Points
  -- **MCP Server Extensions**: Wrap your agent logic and tools as MCP servers/tools for modular integration.
  -- **Custom Toolsets**: Develop specialized code editing or environment interaction tools optimized for your agent workflows.
  -- **Benchmarking**: Use or adapt SWE-Bench-Verified or similar benchmarks to evaluate your agents’ real-world performance.
