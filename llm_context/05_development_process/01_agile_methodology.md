# Agile Development Process Guide

## Scrum Framework

### Roles
- **Product Owner**: Manages product backlog, prioritizes features
- **Scrum Master**: Facilitates process, removes impediments
- **Development Team**: Self-organizing team that delivers product increments

### Artifacts
- **Product Backlog**: Prioritized list of all features, enhancements, and fixes
- **Sprint Backlog**: Set of items selected for the sprint
- **Increment**: Usable product at the end of each sprint

### Events
- **Sprint**: Time-boxed period (2-4 weeks) to deliver a product increment
- **Sprint Planning**: Meeting to define sprint goals and backlog items
- **Daily Scrum**: 15-minute synchronization meeting
- **Sprint Review**: Demonstration of completed work
- **Sprint Retrospective**: Reflection on the sprint process

## User Story Format

```
As a [role]
I want [feature]
So that [benefit]
```

Example:
```
As an MCP developer
I want to integrate Gemini API with agent roles
So that agents can have advanced reasoning capabilities
```

### Acceptance Criteria Format

```
Given [context]
When [action]
Then [expected result]
```

Example:
```
Given an agent with Gemini integration
When the agent receives a complex reasoning task
Then it should use Gemini's reasoning capabilities to solve the task accurately
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Feature Planning
- Capture requirements as user stories
- Define acceptance criteria
- Estimate complexity (story points)
- Prioritize in product backlog

### 2. Sprint Planning
- Select stories for sprint
- Break down into tasks
- Assign initial owners
- Set sprint goals

### 3. Development
- Implement features
- Follow coding standards
- Write unit tests
- Document code
- Perform code reviews

### 4. Testing
- Run automated tests
- Perform manual testing
- Verify acceptance criteria
- Report and fix bugs

### 5. Deployment
- Merge to staging
- Deploy to staging environment
- Perform integration testing
- Deploy to production

### 6. Review and Retrospective
- Demo completed features
- Gather feedback
- Discuss what went well
- Identify improvement areas

## Continuous Integration/Deployment

### CI Pipeline
1. Code commit triggers pipeline
2. Run linting and static analysis
3. Build application
4. Run unit tests
5. Generate test coverage reports

### CD Pipeline
1. Deploy to development environment
2. Run integration tests
3. Deploy to staging environment
4. Run acceptance tests
5. Manual approval for production
6. Deploy to production
7. Run smoke tests

## Definition of Done

- Code meets coding standards
- Unit tests written and passing
- Integration tests passing
- Acceptance criteria met
- Code reviewed and approved
- Documentation updated
- No known bugs
- Product owner approval
