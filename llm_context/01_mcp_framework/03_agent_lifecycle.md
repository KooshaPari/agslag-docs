# MCP Agent Lifecycle

## Agent Lifecycle Stages
- Registration and initialization
- Capability declaration
- Role assignment
- Status management (available, working, idle, offline, error)
- Deregistration and cleanup

## Registration Process
```javascript
// Example agent registration
const agentData = {
  name: "Frontend Developer",
  role: "developer",
  model_type: "gemini",
  model_version: "2.5-pro",
  capabilities: ["javascript", "react", "ui_design"]
};

const agent = await register_agent(agentData);
console.log(`Agent registered with ID: ${agent.id}`);
```

## Status Management
Agents can have the following status values:
- `available`: Ready to accept new tasks
- `working`: Currently processing a task
- `idle`: Finished current task, waiting for next assignment
- `offline`: Agent is not active
- `error`: Agent has encountered an issue

```javascript
// Reporting agent status
await report_status({
  agent_id: "agent-123",
  status: "working",
  current_task: "Implementing UI components",
  progress_metric: 0.45  // 45% complete
});
```

## Capability Management
Agents should declare their capabilities during registration to enable proper task assignment:

```javascript
// Define agent capabilities
const capabilities = [
  "javascript",
  "react",
  "api_integration",
  "ui_design",
  "testing"
];

// Register with capabilities
const agent = await register_agent({
  name: "Frontend Developer",
  role: "developer",
  model_type: "gemini",
  model_version: "2.5-pro",
  capabilities: capabilities
});
```

## Deregistration
Agents should properly deregister when they're no longer needed:

```javascript
// Deregister an agent
await deregister_agent({
  agent_id: "agent-123"
});
```
