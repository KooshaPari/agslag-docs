# MCP Agentic Architecture: Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the implementation plan for a fully automated Model Context Protocol (MCP) architecture supporting both local UI-automated clients and cloud-based programmatic implementations. The architecture follows a containerized approach with Git-based collaboration, focusing on code quality through comprehensive stage gating processes.

The plan defines how various MCP agentic clients (Cline, Roo Code, Aider, and custom implementations) will be deployed in containers, how they will interact with repositories via team branches, and how a robust CI/CD pipeline will enforce quality standards through multiple stage gates.

## Architecture Overview

The proposed architecture consists of two primary environments:

1. **Local Environment (UI Automation)**
   - Leverages UI automation techniques to interact with VS Code extensions (Cline, Roo Code)
   - Includes terminal-based agents like Aider
   - Operates on developers' machines for testing and experimentation

2. **Cloud Environment (Programmatic API)**
   - Uses headless MCP clients via programmatic APIs
   - Leverages remote MCP servers deployed on cloud platforms
   - Operates in containerized environments for scalability and reliability

All agents interact with a central GitHub repository following a branching strategy that includes:
- Feature branches for individual tasks
- Team branches for coordinated work
- Main branch for production code

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Local Environment Setup (Weeks 1-4)

#### 1.1 UI Automation Framework

Implement UI automation for VS Code extensions using Playwright or Puppeteer:

```javascript
// Example automation script for Cline
const { chromium } = require('playwright');

async function automateVSCode() {
  const browser = await chromium.launch({
    headless: false,  // Initially develop with UI visible
    slowMo: 50        // Slow down for debugging
  });
  
  const context = await browser.newContext();
  const page = await context.newPage();
  
  // Navigate to VS Code Web or connect to local VS Code instance
  await page.goto('https://vscode.dev/');
  
  // Wait for VS Code to load
  await page.waitForSelector('.monaco-editor
