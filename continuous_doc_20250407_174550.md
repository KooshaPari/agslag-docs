## Summary

This paper introduces **SelfExtend**, a method to extend the context window of large language models (LLMs) **without any fine-tuning**.

### Motivation

- LLMs typically cannot generalize well to input sequences longer than those seen during training.
- This limits their ability to process long documents, multi-turn conversations, or multi-document inputs.

### Method: SelfExtend

- **Bi-level attention mechanism**:
  - **Grouped attention**: captures dependencies among distant tokens.
  - **Neighbor attention**: captures dependencies among adjacent tokens.
- Both are computed **during inference** using the existing self-attention layers, requiring only **minor code modifications**.
- No additional training or fine-tuning is needed.

### Results

- Demonstrated effective extension of context window length on multiple benchmarks.
- Maintains or improves performance on long-context tasks.
- Spotlight paper at ICML 2024.

## Relevance to Our Project

- **MCP servers and LLM orchestration** can benefit from longer context windows without retraining models.
- Enables:
  - **Multi-document reasoning** (e.g., combining multiple knowledge sources).
  - **Longer conversations** or **multi-agent dialogues** with full context.
  - **Processing large codebases or documents** in a single pass.
- Can be integrated into existing inference pipelines with minimal engineering effort.
- Avoids the need for expensive fine-tuning or specialized long-context models.

## Next Steps

- Consider integrating SelfExtend into our LLM inference stack.
- Evaluate its impact on multi-agent workflows and long-context tasks.
- Explore the code (link in paper) for implementation details.
