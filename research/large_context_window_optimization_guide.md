# Large Context Window Optimization Guide

This guide outlines techniques for optimizing prompt engineering for large context window models, specifically leveraging a 2M context window.

## Maintaining Project Context in a 2M Window

*   **Comprehensive Project Understanding:** Utilize tools like `everything search` to quickly index and search across the entire project codebase. This allows for efficient retrieval of relevant code snippets, documentation, and other project-related information.
*   **Efficient Information Management:** Implement a knowledge management strategy using `memorymesh` to store and retrieve key project details, dependencies, and architectural decisions. This ensures that the model has access to the necessary context without exceeding the context window limits.
*   **Structured Communication Protocol:** Establish a clear communication protocol for cross-agent interaction, ensuring that information is exchanged efficiently and effectively.

## Strategies for Code Analysis Across Large Codebases

*   **Code Analysis Frameworks:** Develop frameworks for analyzing code across large codebases, focusing on identifying code patterns, dependencies, and potential areas for optimization.
*   **Specialized Prompts:** Design specialized prompts for code review and development, leveraging the large context window to provide the model with sufficient information to make informed decisions.

## Prompts for Comprehensive Documentation Generation

*   **Documentation Generation Templates:** Create templates for generating comprehensive documentation, including API documentation, user guides, and technical specifications.
*   **Gemini-Specific Integration Patterns:** Develop integration patterns specific to Gemini models, ensuring that the model can effectively utilize the available tools and resources.

## Patterns for Efficient Knowledge Retrieval and Application

*   **Knowledge Management Strategies:** Implement strategies for efficient knowledge retrieval and application, focusing on identifying the most relevant information for a given task.
*   **Research and Development Workflow Templates:** Develop templates for research and development workflows, ensuring that the model can effectively explore new ideas and technologies.

## Frameworks for Complex Reasoning Across Large Contexts

*   **Orchestration Frameworks:** Develop orchestration frameworks for complex workflows, ensuring that the model can effectively manage and coordinate multiple tasks.
*   **Problem-Solving Frameworks:** Establish a collaborative problem-solving framework, enabling the model to work effectively with other agents to address complex challenges.

## Integration Patterns Specific to Gemini Models

*   **Gemini API Integration:** Develop integration patterns for the Gemini API, ensuring that the model can effectively utilize the available tools and resources.
*   **Tool Usage Templates:** Create templates for common MCP tool usage patterns, ensuring that the model can effectively utilize the available tools and resources.
