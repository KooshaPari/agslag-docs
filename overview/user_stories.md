# User Stories

This document outlines user stories for the Agslag platform, describing desired functionality from the perspective of different user roles.

## Developer Role

*   **As a Developer,** I want to easily connect a new MCP server to the central Agslag system, so that I can extend the platform's capabilities with custom tools.
*   **As a Developer,** I want to view the status and logs of my running MCP servers through a unified dashboard, so that I can monitor their health and troubleshoot issues quickly.
*   **As a Developer,** I want to define clear input/output schemas for my MCP tools, so that agents and other services can interact with them reliably.
*   **As a Developer,** I want to utilize pre-built MCP clients in various languages (e.g., TypeScript, Python), so that I can integrate MCP communication into my applications efficiently.
*   **As a Developer,** I want to access documentation and examples for creating and managing MCP servers and clients, so that I can learn the development workflow effectively.

## Product Manager Role

*   **As a Product Manager,** I want to define and visualize complex workflows involving multiple agents and MCP tools, so that I can design and understand product features.
*   **As a Product Manager,** I want to track the progress and status of different stages within a digital product lifecycle managed by the platform, so that I can oversee product development.
*   **As a Product Manager,** I want to generate reports on agent performance and workflow efficiency, so that I can identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement.
*   **As a Product Manager,** I want to configure different agent personas and capabilities, so that I can tailor the system's behavior for specific use cases.

## DevOps Engineer Role

*   **As a DevOps Engineer,** I want to deploy and scale MCP servers reliably using standard infrastructure tools (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes), so that the platform remains stable and performant.
*   **As a DevOps Engineer,** I want to monitor the overall health and resource usage of the Agslag platform, including the central server and connected MCP servers, so that I can ensure operational stability.
*   **As a DevOps Engineer,** I want to manage access control and security policies for different MCP servers and resources, so that sensitive operations and data are protected.

## UI/UX Designer Role

*   **As a UI/UX Designer,** I want to understand the interaction patterns between users, agents, and MCP tools, so that I can design intuitive user interfaces for managing and monitoring the system.
*   **As a UI/UX Designer,** I want tools to prototype and test user interfaces that interact with the Agslag backend, so that I can iterate on designs effectively.

## Sales/Marketing/Support Roles (Example Workflows)

*   **As a Sales Representative,** I want the system to automatically generate product proposals based on customer requirements gathered via an agent, so that I can respond to leads faster.
*   **As a Marketing Manager,** I want to use an agent to analyze market trends by querying external data sources via MCP tools, so that I can inform marketing campaigns.
*   **As a Customer Support Agent,** I want the system to automatically diagnose common customer issues using specific MCP tools and suggest solutions, so that I can resolve tickets more efficiently.
