## Summary

This paper introduces **InfLLM**, a **training-free** method to enable large language models (LLMs) to process **extremely long sequences** far beyond their pre-training length.

### Motivation

- LLMs are pre-trained on sequences of limited length (a few thousand tokens).
- They struggle with **long streaming inputs** common in real-world applications (e.g., LLM-driven agents, multi-document reasoning).
- Existing solutions require **expensive continual pre-training** on longer sequences, which can alter model behavior.

### Method: InfLLM

- Adds **external memory units** to store **distant context**.
- During inference, uses an **efficient lookup** to retrieve **token-relevant memory units** for attention computation.
- Allows LLMs to **efficiently process long sequences** with a limited context window.
- Captures **long-distance dependencies** without fine-tuning.

### Results

- Enables LLMs trained on short sequences to handle **up to 1 million tokens**.
- Achieves performance comparable to fine-tuned baselines.
- No additional training or fine-tuning required.

## Relevance to Our Project

- **MCP servers and LLM orchestration** can leverage InfLLM to:
  - Support **streaming, multi-turn, or multi-document inputs** without retraining.
  - Enable **scalable long-context reasoning** for agents and workflows.
  - Improve **memory efficiency** by focusing attention on relevant context.
  - Combine with other context extension methods (e.g., SelfExtend) for enhanced capabilities.

## Next Steps

- Explore integrating InfLLM into our LLM inference stack.
- Evaluate its impact on multi-agent workflows and long-context tasks.
- Review the code (link in paper) for implementation details.
