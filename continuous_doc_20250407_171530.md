## Next Actions

- **Immediate Readiness:**  
  Upon receiving any user instruction, I will:
  - Create a new timestamped documentation file
  - Capture the task description
  - Analyze relevant files or context
  - Outline a plan
  - Execute the task step-by-step with detailed commentary
  - Persistently document all reasoning, actions, and results

- **User Input Needed:**  
  Please specify a concrete task or file to analyze, modify, or extend.
