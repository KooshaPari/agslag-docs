# Jarvis SWE Agent Multi-Agent System Enhancement

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the strategy for implementing sophisticated multi-agent coordination capabilities in the Jarvis SWE Agent. Analysis of leading SWE agents like OpenManus and ANUS reveals that advanced multi-agent coordination is essential for complex software engineering tasks. The current Jarvis implementation offers only basic workflow capabilities without specialized agent roles or structured communication protocols.
