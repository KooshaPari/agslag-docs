# High-Level Functional Requirements

This document outlines the high-level functional requirements for the Agslag platform, derived from user stories and use cases.

## 1. MCP Server Management

*   **REQ-MCP-001:** The system MUST allow authorized users (Developers) to register new MCP servers by providing connection details (address, port, authentication).
*   **REQ-MCP-002:** The system MUST verify the connection and authentication details provided during MCP server registration.
*   **REQ-MCP-003:** The system MUST maintain a list of registered and currently connected MCP servers.
*   **REQ-MCP-004:** The system MUST provide an interface (Dashboard/CLI) for users to view the status (e.g., connected, disconnected, error) of registered MCP servers.
*   **REQ-MCP-005:** The system MUST allow authorized users to view basic logs or health information from connected MCP servers (details TBD).
*   **REQ-MCP-006:** The system MUST allow authorized users to de-register or remove MCP servers.
*   **REQ-MCP-007:** MCP servers MUST adhere to the defined Model Context Protocol specification for communication.

## 2. Workflow Definition & Execution

*   **REQ-WF-001:** The system MUST provide a mechanism for users (Product Managers) to define workflows consisting of sequential or parallel steps involving agents and MCP tool calls.
*   **REQ-WF-002:** The system MUST allow workflows to be saved, retrieved, and modified.
*   **REQ-WF-003:** The system MUST allow users or automated triggers to initiate the execution of a defined workflow.
*   **REQ-WF-004:** The system's orchestrator MUST manage the state and progression of active workflow executions.
*   **REQ-WF-005:** The system MUST handle data passing between steps within a workflow.
*   **REQ-WF-006:** The system MUST log the execution history, status (success, failure, in-progress), and results of workflow runs.
*   **REQ-WF-007:** The system MUST provide basic error handling and reporting for failed workflow steps (e.g., agent failure, tool failure).

## 3. Agent Interaction

*   **REQ-AGENT-001:** Agents within the system MUST be able to discover and interact with registered MCP servers and their tools based on workflow definitions.
*   **REQ-AGENT-002:** The system MUST support the configuration of different agent personas or capabilities (details TBD).
*   **REQ-AGENT-003:** The system MUST provide a mechanism for agents to report status and results back to the workflow orchestrator.

## 4. Platform Monitoring & Administration

*   **REQ-ADMIN-001:** The system SHOULD provide monitoring capabilities for the overall health and resource usage of the central platform components.
*   **REQ-ADMIN-002:** The system MUST support basic user roles and permissions for accessing different platform features (e.g., server management, workflow definition). (Specific roles TBD).
