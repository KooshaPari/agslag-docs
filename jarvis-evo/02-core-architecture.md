# Jarvis Evolution: Core Architecture

## Core Architecture

The evolved Jarvis will follow a layered architecture:

### 1. Foundation Layer
- **Context Engine**: Adapted from Augment's context management system
- **Memory System**: Hybrid of ANUS memory management and Augment's context isolation
- **Configuration System**: Unified configuration based on Cline and Claude Code approaches

### 2. Service Layer
- **Agent Registry Service**: Enhanced version of the existing service with capability tracking
- **Task Delegation Service**: Improved with RooCode's Boomerang/Subtasks functionality
- **Tool Service**: Expanded with a comprehensive tool registry and discovery mechanism
- **Reliability Service**: Incorporating Upsonic's verification layers

### 3. Tool Layer
- **File System Tools**: Enhanced with Claude Code's robust file operations
- **Browser Automation**: Integrated from Manus/OpenManus
- **Code Analysis Tools**: Adapted from Claude Code and Augment
- **Multi-Agent Coordination Tools**: Based on OpenManus team coordination

### 4. Orchestration Layer
- **Workflow Engine**: Graph-based workflow execution from OpenManus
- **Task Scheduler**: Advanced scheduling from Cline
- **Agent Coordinator**: Team-based coordination from OpenManus

### 5. Interface Layer
- **API**: RESTful and WebSocket APIs for programmatic control
- **CLI**: Command-line interface inspired by Claude Code
- **Web UI**: Enhanced dashboard with 3D visualization
