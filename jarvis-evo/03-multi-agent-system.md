# Jarvis Evolution: Multi-Agent System

## Multi-Agent System

The evolved Jarvis will implement a team-based multi-agent system:

### 1. Agent Roles
- **Coordinator**: Manages task delegation and team coordination
- **Planner**: Breaks down complex tasks into subtasks
- **Researcher**: Gathers information from the web and documentation
- **Coder**: Generates and modifies code
- **Reviewer**: Verifies code quality and correctness
- **Browser Agent**: Handles web interactions
- **Reporter**: Generates reports and documentation

### 2. Coordination Patterns
- **Hierarchical**: Coordinator delegates tasks to specialized agents
- **Consensus**: Multiple agents collaborate on complex decisions
- **Autonomous**: Agents work independently on assigned tasks

### 3. Communication Protocol
- **Standardized Message Format**: Structured messages with sender, recipient, and payload
- **Direct Messaging**: Point-to-point communication between agents
- **Broadcast Messaging**: One-to-many communication for team updates
- **Threaded Discussions**: Organized conversations around specific topics
