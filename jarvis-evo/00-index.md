## Overview

This document series outlines a comprehensive plan for evolving Jarvis into an apex agent by integrating the best features and techniques from various agent repositories including Augment, Claude Code, RooCode, Manus, OpenManus, ANUS, Upsonic, and Cline. The goal is to create a unified, powerful agent that combines the strengths of each system while maintaining a cohesive architecture and user experience.

The evolution plan is divided into logical sections that can be reviewed and implemented independently, while maintaining a cohesive overall vision for the next generation of Jarvis.
