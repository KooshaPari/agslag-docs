# Jarvis Evolution: Conclusion and References

## Conclusion

The evolved Jarvis will represent a significant advancement in agent technology, combining the best features and techniques from various agent repositories into a unified, powerful system. By integrating Augment's context engine, Claude Code's coding capabilities, RooCode's task management, Manus/OpenManus's multi-agent coordination, ANUS's memory management, Upsonic's reliability features, and Cline's orchestration, Jarvis will become a truly apex agent capable of handling complex software development tasks with unprecedented efficiency and reliability.

The implementation strategy outlined in this document provides a clear path forward, with a phased approach that ensures steady progress while maintaining system stability. The resulting system will not only enhance the capabilities of Jarvis but also establish a new standard for AI-powered software development assistance.
