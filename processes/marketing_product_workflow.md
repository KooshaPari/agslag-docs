## Integration

Marketing works closely with [Product Management](./product_management_workflow.md) to ensure product messaging aligns with features and strategy. Collaboration with [Sales](./sales_product_workflow.md) is critical for effective GTM execution and lead handoff. Feedback loops with [Customer Support](./customer_support_workflow.md) and Data Analysis inform ongoing campaigns and product positioning adjustments. Marketing also relies on [UI/UX Design](./ui_ux_design_workflow.md) for visual consistency and [DevOps](./devops_workflow.md) for technical deployment of web assets.
