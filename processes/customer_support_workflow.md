# Customer Support Workflow

## Introduction

This document outlines the workflow for the Customer Support team, a critical function for user satisfaction, retention, and providing feedback into the product development process. Support interacts primarily with users post-launch but plays a vital role in ensuring product quality and informing future iterations.

## Key Stages & Activities

Customer Support activities are ongoing after a product is launched:

1.  **User Assistance & Troubleshooting:**
    *   **Activities:**
        *   Managing incoming support requests through a ticketing system (e.g., Zendesk, Jira Service Management, Intercom).
        *   Responding promptly and empathetically across channels (email, live chat, phone, community forums, social media).
        *   Asking clarifying questions to accurately diagnose the user's issue.
        *   Reproducing reported problems when possible.
        *   Providing step-by-step solutions, referencing knowledge base articles, or offering workarounds.
        *   Guiding users on how to use specific features effectively.
        *   Tracking ticket status and ensuring timely resolution according to SLAs (Service Level Agreements).
    *   **Outputs:** Resolved Support Tickets, Updated Ticket Statuses, Interaction Logs within Ticketing System, User Guidance Provided.
    *   **Collaboration:**
        *   Direct interaction with Users.
        *   Potentially consulting internal knowledge bases or senior support staff for complex issues.
2.  **Bug Reporting & Escalation:**
    *   **Activities:**
        *   Identifying potential software bugs based on user reports or troubleshooting.
        *   Verifying and reproducing bugs consistently.
        *   Documenting bugs clearly and concisely in the issue tracking system (e.g., Jira, GitHub Issues), including steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual results, environment details, and user impact.
        *   Linking related support tickets to the bug report.
        *   Prioritizing bugs based on severity and user impact (often in consultation with Product/QA).
        *   Escalating critical or widespread issues (e.g., outages, security vulnerabilities) immediately through defined escalation channels (e.g., PagerDuty, dedicated Slack channel).
    *   **Outputs:** Detailed Bug Reports (in Jira, etc.), Escalation Alerts/Notifications, Linked Support Tickets.
    *   **Collaboration:**
        *   Submitting bug reports for review by QA ([Quality Assurance Protocols](./quality_assurance_protocols.md)) / Engineering ([Software Engineering Process Diagram](./software_engineering_process_diagram.md)).
        *   Providing additional information to QA/Engineering as needed for investigation.
        *   Communicating issue status back to affected users (where appropriate).
3.  **Feedback Collection & Synthesis:**
    *   **Activities:**
        *   Tagging support tickets with relevant feedback categories (e.g., "feature request," "usability issue," "documentation gap").
        *   Actively listening for and noting user suggestions, frustrations, and desired outcomes during interactions.
        *   Logging specific feature requests in a designated tool or system (e.g., Productboard, Canny, Jira project).
        *   Periodically reviewing and synthesizing feedback trends (e.g., most common issues, frequently requested features).
        *   Preparing concise feedback summaries or reports for Product Management.
    *   **Outputs:** Tagged Support Tickets, Feature Request Log Entries, User Feedback Trend Reports/Summaries.
    *   **Collaboration:**
        *   Regular meetings or asynchronous communication with [Product Management](./product_management_workflow.md) to share feedback insights.
        *   Potentially collaborating with Data Analysis to correlate feedback with usage patterns.
4.  **Knowledge Base Management:**
    *   **Activities:**
        *   Identifying documentation gaps based on recurring user questions or issues.
        *   Writing clear, concise, and easy-to-understand help articles, FAQs, and troubleshooting guides (using tools like Zendesk Guide, Confluence, Intercom Articles).
        *   Creating tutorials, potentially including screenshots or short videos.
        *   Regularly reviewing and updating existing articles for accuracy and relevance, especially after product updates.
        *   Organizing knowledge base content for easy navigation and searchability.
        *   Analyzing knowledge base usage metrics to identify popular or ineffective articles.
    *   **Outputs:** New/Updated Knowledge Base Articles, FAQs, Tutorial Content, Internal Support Playbooks.
    *   **Collaboration:**
        *   Getting technical details or validation from [Product Management](./product_management_workflow.md) or Engineering for new feature documentation.
        *   Ensuring tone and branding consistency with [Marketing](./marketing_product_workflow.md) guidelines.
        *   Sharing insights on documentation gaps with Product/Dev teams.
5.  **Pre-Launch Preparation:**
    *   **Activities:**
        *   Participating in internal training sessions and reviewing materials provided by Product/Marketing/Engineering about upcoming releases.
        *   Reviewing draft user documentation and providing feedback.
        *   Developing internal support readiness checklists and playbooks for handling anticipated issues related to the new release.
        *   Updating internal tools or macros if needed.
        *   Participating in UAT or beta testing to gain hands-on experience.
        *   Planning staffing adjustments if a high volume of inquiries is expected post-launch.
    *   **Outputs:** Completed Training, Support Readiness Plan/Checklist, Updated Internal Playbooks, Feedback on User Documentation.
    *   **Collaboration:**
        *   Receiving training and documentation from [Product Management](./product_management_workflow.md), [Marketing](./marketing_product_workflow.md), and Engineering.
        *   Providing feedback on potential support impacts or documentation clarity before launch.
        *   Coordinating readiness efforts with the GTM team.

## Integration

Customer Support is the front line for user interaction post-launch. They provide essential feedback to [Product Management](./product_management_workflow.md) for iteration and report bugs to Engineering/QA for resolution. They collaborate with [Marketing](./marketing_product_workflow.md) on maintaining consistent user-facing documentation and knowledge bases. Their readiness, supported by Product and Engineering, is key during new releases outlined in the [Digital Product Development Lifecycle](./digital_product_lifecycle.md). They also often coordinate with the [Sales](./sales_product_workflow.md) team on customer issues impacting renewals or upsells.
