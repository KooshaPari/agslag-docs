n and # UI/UX Design Workflow

## Introduction

This document outlines the typical workflow followed by the UI/UX Design team during the digital product development lifecycle. This process focuses on understanding user needs, creating intuitive interfaces, and validating design decisions through research and testing. It integrates closely with Product Management and Engineering teams.

## Key Stages

The UI/UX design process is iterative and generally includes these stages:

1.  **Research & Discovery:**
    *   **Activities:**
        *   Reviewing product briefs and business goals provided by Product Management.
        *   Conducting stakeholder interviews (Product, Engineering, Sales, Support, Leadership).
        *   Performing competitor analysis (feature comparison, UX review).
        *   Planning and conducting user research (surveys via SurveyMonkey/Typeform, user interviews, contextual inquiry).
        *   Analyzing research data to synthesize findings.
        *   Developing user personas and empathy maps.
        *   Creating user journey maps to visualize current or ideal experiences.
    *   **Outputs:** User Research Plan & Findings Report, User Personas, Customer Journey Maps, Problem Statements/User Needs Summary.
    *   **Collaboration:**
        *   Kick-off meetings with [Product Management](./product_management_workflow.md).
        *   Sharing research plans and findings with Product and relevant stakeholders.
        *   Leveraging market research data from [Marketing](./marketing_product_workflow.md)/Market Research teams.
2.  **Define & Ideate:**
    *   **Activities:**
        *   Defining the Information Architecture (IA) (e.g., using card sorting, creating site maps in Miro/FigJam).
        *   Mapping out key user flows and task flows (e.g., using flowchart tools like Lucidchart, Miro, Figma).
        *   Facilitating brainstorming sessions (e.g., Crazy 8s, How Might We) with Product/Engineering.
        *   Creating low-fidelity sketches or "paper prototypes" of core screens and interactions.
    *   **Outputs:** Site Maps, User Flow Diagrams, Task Flow Diagrams, Initial Sketches/Concepts.
    *   **Collaboration:**
        *   Workshops with [Product Management](./product_management_workflow.md) and Engineering Leads ([Software Engineering Process Diagram](./software_engineering_process_diagram.md)) to align on flows and core concepts.
        *   Reviewing user stories/requirements from [Product Management](./product_management_workflow.md).
3.  **Wireframing & Prototyping:**
    *   **Activities:**
        *   Developing digital wireframes (low-to-mid fidelity) focusing on layout, structure, and core functionality (e.g., using Figma, Sketch, Axure).
        *   Building interactive prototypes linking wireframes to simulate navigation and key interactions (using prototyping features in Figma, InVision, Axure).
        *   Annotating wireframes with key interaction notes or requirements.
    *   **Outputs:** Digital Wireframes (annotated), Clickable Prototypes.
    *   **Collaboration:**
        *   Regular reviews with [Product Management](./product_management_workflow.md) to ensure alignment with requirements.
        *   Early feasibility checks with Frontend Engineering ([Software Engineering Process Diagram](./software_engineering_process_diagram.md)).
4.  **Usability Testing (Formative):**
    *   **Activities:**
        *   Defining usability test goals and creating test plans/scripts.
        *   Recruiting participants representing target user segments.
        *   Conducting moderated or unmoderated usability testing sessions (using tools like UserTesting.com, Lookback, Maze, or direct observation).
        *   Analyzing test results (qualitative feedback, task success rates, time on task).
        *   Synthesizing findings and identifying key usability issues.
        *   Iterating on wireframes/prototypes based on test findings.
    *   **Outputs:** Usability Test Plan & Scripts, Test Session Recordings/Notes, Usability Findings Report, Revised Wireframes/Prototypes.
    *   **Collaboration:**
        *   Reviewing test plans and observing sessions with [Product Management](./product_management_workflow.md).
        *   Direct interaction with test participants (Users).
        *   Sharing key findings with Engineering ([Software Engineering Process Diagram](./software_engineering_process_diagram.md)) for awareness.
5.  **Visual Design & UI:**
    *   **Activities:**
        *   Applying brand guidelines, color palettes, typography, and visual style to wireframes.
        *   Creating high-fidelity mockups for all key screens and states (e.g., in Figma, Sketch).
        *   Designing UI components (buttons, forms, modals, etc.) and documenting their states and behaviors.
        *   Developing or contributing to a Design System/UI Kit for consistency and reusability.
        *   Creating detailed design specifications including spacing, typography, color values, and accessibility annotations (e.g., WCAG compliance notes).
    *   **Outputs:** High-Fidelity Mockups, UI Kit / Design System Documentation, Style Guides, Detailed Design Specifications.
    *   **Collaboration:**
        *   Reviewing visual designs with [Product Management](./product_management_workflow.md) and key stakeholders.

        *   Consulting brand guidelines from [Marketing](./marketing_product_workflow.md) if applicable.
6.  **Design Handoff & Support:**
    *   **Activities:**
        *   Organizing and exporting final design assets (icons, images) in required formats and resolutions.
        *   Providing comprehensive design specifications (using tools like Figma's inspect mode, Zeplin, or manual documentation).
        *   Conducting formal handoff meetings with Engineering and QA to walk through designs and specifications.
        *   Being available to answer questions and clarify design details during development sprints.
        *   Performing "design QA" by reviewing implemented UI against mockups and specs, logging visual/interaction bugs.
    *   **Outputs:** Exported Design Assets, Final Design Specifications Document/Link, Design QA Bug Reports/Feedback.
    *   **Collaboration:**
        *   Handoff meetings with Engineering ([Software Engineering Process Diagram](./software_engineering_process_diagram.md)) (Frontend primarily, Backend for API/data needs) and QA ([Quality Assurance Protocols](./quality_assurance_protocols.md)).
        *   Ongoing communication via Slack, Jira comments, or meetings during sprints.
        *   Pairing with developers for complex interactions if needed.
7.  **Post-Launch Evaluation (Summative):**
    *   **Activities:**
        *   Collaborating with Data Analysis to understand user behavior through analytics (heatmaps, funnel analysis, feature adoption rates).
        *   Reviewing user feedback collected by Customer Support and Product Management.
        *   Conducting post-launch usability testing or surveys to evaluate the live product experience.
        *   Performing heuristic evaluations or design audits on the live product.
        *   Identifying areas for UX improvement and proposing design iterations.
    *   **Outputs:** UX Performance Reports (based on analytics/feedback), Summative Usability Test Reports, Heuristic Evaluation Reports, Design Recommendations for Iteration.

## Integration

This workflow feeds directly into the Development (Engineering) phase ([Software Engineering Process Diagram](./software_engineering_process_diagram.md)) and receives input from the Planning & Requirements phase outlined in the overall [Digital Product Development Lifecycle](./digital_product_lifecycle.md). Continuous collaboration with [Product Management](./product_management_workflow.md), Engineering, and [QA](./quality_assurance_protocols.md) ensures alignment between design, product vision, and technical feasibility. Post-launch evaluation involves collaboration with [Data Analysis](#collaboration-links-illustrative) and [Customer Support](./customer_support_workflow.md). Visual consistency is maintained through coordination with [Marketing](./marketing_product_workflow.md) where applicable.
