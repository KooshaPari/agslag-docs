# System Architecture: AI-Powered Digital Product Development Platform

## Architecture Overview

This document details the current technical architecture of our AI-powered digital product development platform. It leverages a multi-agent system built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP) framework with Gemini API integration via VertexAI. The architecture is designed to support end-to-end digital product development through autonomous agent collaboration that mirrors real-world tech company processes.

*(For planned enhancements and future architectural considerations, see the [Architecture Enhancement Plan](./architecture_enhancement_plan.md).)*

- **Request Formatting**: Preparation of prompts and context for Gemini models
- **Response Processing**: Handling and parsing of model outputs

### Gemini Model Utilization
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro**: Primary model for complex reasoning and generation tasks
- **Model Context Management**: Efficient handling of context windows
- **Parameter Optimization**: Tuning of temperature, top-p, and other parameters
- **Prompt Engineering**: Specialized prompts for different agent roles

### Tool Integration
The Gemini models will have access to the same tools available in the MCP framework:
- Communication tools for agent interaction
- Collaboration tools for team coordination
- Workflow tools for process management
- Knowledge tools for information sharing
- Role tools for responsibility management
- File management tools for artifact handling
- Project management tools for coordination
