## What is MCP?

[MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is an open protocol that enables AI models to securely interact with local and remote resources through standardized server implementations. This list focuses on production-ready and experimental MCP servers that extend AI capabilities through file access, database connections, API integrations, and other contextual services.

## Clients

Checkout [awesome-mcp-clients](https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-clients/) and [glama.ai/mcp/clients](https://glama.ai/mcp/clients).

> [!TIP] > [Glama Chat](https://glama.ai/chat) is a multi-modal AI client with MCP support & [AI gateway](https://glama.ai/gateway).

This repository is a collection of _reference implementations_ for the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP), as well as references
to community built servers and additional resources.

The servers in this repository showcase the versatility and extensibility of MCP, demonstrating how it can be used to give Large Language Models (LLMs) secure, controlled access to tools and data sources.
Each MCP server is implemented with either the [Typescript MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk) or [Python MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk).

> Note: Lists in this README are maintained in alphabetical order to minimize merge conflicts when adding new items.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Using MCP Servers in this Repository

Typescript-based servers in this repository can be used directly with `npx`.

For example, this will start the [Memory](src/memory) server:

```sh
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory
```

Python-based servers in this repository can be used directly with [`uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/tools/) or [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/pip/). `uvx` is recommended for ease of use and setup.

For example, this will start the [Git](src/git) server:

```sh
# With uvx
uvx mcp-server-git

# With pip
pip install mcp-server-git
python -m mcp_server_git
```

Follow [these](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) instructions to install `uv` / `uvx` and [these](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) to install `pip`.

### Using an MCP Client

However, running a server on its own isn't very useful, and should instead be configured into an MCP client. For example, here's the Claude Desktop configuration to use the above server:

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"memory": {
			"command": "npx",
			"args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]
		}
	}
}
```

Additional examples of using the Claude Desktop as an MCP client might look like:

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"filesystem": {
			"command": "npx",
			"args": [
				"-y",
				"@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
				"/path/to/allowed/files"
			]
		},
		"git": {
			"command": "uvx",
			"args": ["mcp-server-git", "--repository", "path/to/git/repo"]
		},
		"github": {
			"command": "npx",
			"args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
			"env": {
				"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<YOUR_TOKEN>"
			}
		},
		"postgres": {
			"command": "npx",
			"args": [
				"-y",
				"@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres",
				"postgresql://localhost/mydb"
			]
		}
	}
}
```
