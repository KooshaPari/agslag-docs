## 4. Core Technologies

### Model Context Protocol (MCP) Framework

MCP serves as the backbone for inter-agent communication and collaboration.

#### LiteMCP & ws-mcp

*   **LiteMCP:** The primary TypeScript framework used for building MCP servers (agents). It offers a simple API, type safety (Zod), support for stdio/SSE transports, resource management, prompt templating, and logging. Used for creating specialized agent servers (search, file management, etc.).
*   **ws-mcp:** A utility wrapping MCP servers (like those built with LiteMCP) with a WebSocket interface. It enables real-time, bidirectional communication with web clients and can manage multiple underlying MCP servers.

#### Agent Communication System

Built on MCP, this system enables structured communication:

*   **Architecture:** Layered approach including Transport (MCP), Communication Services (Routing, Delivery, Persistence), and Communication Protocol (Message Format, Threads).
*   **Core Models:**
    *   `Message`: Unit of communication (ID, sender, recipient(s), thread ID, content, timestamp, urgent flag, attachments).
    *   `Thread`: Structured conversation (ID, title, creator, participants, timestamps, status).
*   **Tools:** Comprehensive set for sending/receiving direct and broadcast messages (`send_message`, `broadcast_message`, `get_messages`), managing threads (`create_thread`, `join_thread`, `add_participant_to_thread`), and transferring files (`transfer_file`).
*   **Security:** Includes message validation (sender, content, rate limits) and access controls.

#### Orchestration Framework

Coordinates interactions and manages complex multi-agent workflows:

*   **Architecture:** Hierarchical, event-driven system with Agent Registry, Workflow Engine, Task Decomposition, Event Coordination, Resource Allocation, and Progress Monitoring.
*   **Core Concepts:**
    *   `RegisteredAgent`: Tracks agent capabilities, status, availability.
    *   `Workflow`: Defines multi-step processes with dependencies.
    *   `Task`/`Subtask`: Units of work assignable to agents.
*   **Tools:** Extensive tools for managing agents (`register_agent`, `find_agents`), workflows (`define_workflow`, `execute_workflow`, `report_step_completion`), tasks (`decompose_task`, `assign_subtasks`, `delegate_subtask`, `merge_results`), coordination (`create_collaboration_session`, `request_assistance`), anti-jamming (`check_agent_responsiveness`), file locking (`acquire_file_lock`), and project/goal management (`create_project`, `create_goal`).
*   **Patterns:** Supports Hub-and-Spoke, Peer-to-Peer, Assembly Line, and Hierarchical orchestration patterns.
*   **Integration:** Connects with Communication System and Knowledge Graph.

### Gemini API Integration via VertexAI

Leverages Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro model for advanced AI capabilities:

*   **Capabilities:** Advanced reasoning, multimodal understanding, long context, code generation, tool use.
*   **Integration Architecture:** Connects via VertexAI (Authentication, Request/Response Handling). Includes an Agent Provisioning System (Creation, Context Management, Tool Integration) and an MCP-Gemini Bridge (Protocol Translation, State Management, Resource Optimization).
*   **Implementation Approach:**
    *   **Agent Configuration:** Role-specific system instructions, model parameters (temperature, top-p/k, safety), and tool access controls.
    *   **Communication Flow:** Request Formation -> API Interaction -> Response Processing.
    *   **Prompt Engineering:** Role-based prompting, few-shot examples, chain-of-thought techniques.
*   **Tool Integration:** Gemini agents can access the full suite of MCP tools (Communication, Collaboration, Workflow, Knowledge, Role, Project Management).
*   **Performance Optimization:** Strategies for context window management (prioritization, chunking, memory systems), cost efficiency (token optimization, caching, batching), and latency reduction (connection pooling, pre-fetching).
*   **Security & Compliance:** Data minimization, encryption, access control, content filtering, bias mitigation, transparency.
*   **Monitoring:** Tracks performance (response times, success rates), usage (token consumption, tool use), and provides alerts.

### Knowledge Management System

Enables agents to store, query, and reason with structured knowledge.

#### Knowledge Graph Architecture

*   **Components:** Client Agents interact via a Protocol Layer with a Graph Storage Engine (Node/Edge Store, Search Indexing) backed by various Storage Backends (In-memory, Persistent, Vector DB). Key functions include Entity, Relation, and Observation Management, Graph Traversal, Search, and Reasoning Support.
*   **Core Models:**
    *   `Entity`: Represents concepts/objects (name, entityType, observations, metadata, timestamps). Supports domain-specific types (Person, Task, Document, etc.).
    *   `Relation`: Directional connection between entities (from, to, relationType, weight, metadata, timestamps).
*   **Tools:** Comprehensive tools for managing entities (`create_entities`, `update_node`, `delete_entities`, `add_observations`, `delete_observations`), relations (`create_relations`, `delete_relations`), and querying (`read_graph`, `search_nodes`, `open_nodes`).
*   **Integration:** Integrates with LLM-based knowledge extraction pipelines and the Agent Communication system. Enhances agent capabilities through role-based knowledge access and persistence.

#### Knowledge Management Strategies

Leverages large context windows effectively:

*   **Principles:** Structured Context, Prioritization, Summarization/Abstraction, Persistent Knowledge (via `memorymesh`), Targeted Retrieval Prompts.
*   **Patterns:**
    *   Context Structuring and Indexing (using Markdown/tags and a context index).
    *   On-Demand Detail Expansion (loading summaries first, full code later if needed).
    *   Contextual Markers and Retrieval Prompts (using unique markers for search).
    *   Persistent Knowledge with `memorymesh` (storing summaries, dependencies, decisions).
    *   Query Decomposition and Synthesis (breaking down complex queries).
*   **Tool Integration:** Relies on `read_file`, `memorymesh`, search tools, and `list_code_definition_names`.

### Implementation Considerations

*   **Technical:** GCP preferred (VertexAI), containerized (Docker/K8s), HA config, CI/CD, automated testing, security measures (encryption, RBAC, logging).
*   **Resources:** Estimated team size (AI/ML, Backend, Frontend, DevOps, QA, PM), cloud infrastructure needs, external services (VertexAI, storage, monitoring, security).
*   **Risks:** API limitations (mitigation: context mgmt, batching), integration complexity (mitigation: testing, gradual rollout), performance bottlenecks (mitigation: profiling, load testing), scope creep (mitigation: clear phases), resource constraints (mitigation: phased approach), timeline pressure (mitigation: prioritization).

### Success Factors

*   **Critical:** Strong MCP-Gemini integration, effective agent specialization/collaboration, reliable workflow execution, high-fidelity process replication, scalable architecture.
*   **KPIs:** Concurrent projects managed, dev time reduction, quality metrics, user satisfaction, system reliability.
