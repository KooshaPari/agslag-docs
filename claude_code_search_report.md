# Claude Code Search System - Technical Report

*Generated on 2025-04-07*

## Overview

This report summarizes the architecture, components, algorithms, and workflows of the Claude file search system, based on the detailed breakdown from the provided gist.

The system is designed for **real-time, flexible, LLM-integrated code search** without indexing, leveraging ripgrep and multiple specialized tools.

---

## Core Architecture and Features

- **No Indexing:**  
  Searches are performed live using ripgrep, ensuring always up-to-date results without pre-processing.

- **Ripgrep Integration:**  
  High-performance regex search engine with cross-platform support, fallback binaries, abort signals, and timeouts.

- **Regex Power:**  
  Supports PCRE, Unicode, lookarounds, capture groups, word boundaries, etc.

- **File Listing:**  
  Uses ripgrep to list all content files respecting ignore patterns.

- **Multiple Specialized Tools:**  
  - **GrepTool:** Finds files matching regex patterns (returns file paths only).  
  - **FileReadTool:** Reads file content with pagination and size limits.  
  - **GlobTool:** Finds files matching glob patterns.  
  - **LSTool:** Lists directory contents recursively.  
  - **AgentTool:** Spawns Claude agents for complex, multi-step searches.

- **Two-Step Content Access:**  
  1. GrepTool finds relevant files (paths only).  
  2. FileReadTool reads content of selected files, with pagination for large files.

## Search Query Processing Flow

1. **User Query** →  
2. **Claude LLM Analysis** →  
3. **Tool Selection (GrepTool, GlobTool, LSTool, AgentTool)** →  
4. **Search Execution** →  
5. **Result Ranking (modification time)** →  
6. **Result Formatting and Display**

---

## Result Ranking and Processing

- **Time-based Ranking:**  
  Most recently modified files appear first.

- **No ML Re-ranker:**  
  Purely algorithmic ranking.

- **Result Limiting:**  
  Caps on number of results and file size.

- **Formatting:**  
  Adds line numbers, normalizes paths, tree views for directories.

---

## AgentTool: Advanced Search

- Spawns a separate Claude instance for complex, multi-step searches.
- Uses a specialized prompt to guide concise, direct responses.
- Manages tool access carefully (read-only by default).
- Collects and consolidates results from multiple tool invocations.

---

## Performance Optimizations

- **LRU Caching:**  
  For file encodings and line endings.

- **Timeouts and Abort Signals:**  
  Prevents hanging on large or slow searches.

- **Result Truncation:**  
  Limits large outputs with warnings.
