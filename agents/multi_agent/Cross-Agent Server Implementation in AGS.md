Cross-Agent Server Implementation in AGSLAG Repository
Core Architecture
The cross-agent server in the AGSLAG repository implements a hub-and-spoke model for agent communication and coordination. The key components include:

1. WebSocket Server (websocketServer.ts)
   The WebSocketServerManager class is the central hub for all agent connections:

It manages WebSocket connections from multiple agents
Handles agent registration and identification
Routes messages between agents
Maintains a registry of connected clients
Implements heartbeat mechanism to detect disconnected agents
Integrates with the workflow engine for task management 2. WebSocket Client (websocketClient.ts)
The WebSocketClient class represents an agent connection to the server:

Manages connection to the WebSocket server
Handles reconnection logic
Sends and receives messages
Maintains agent identity and capabilities
Implements heartbeat mechanism 3. Communication Tools (tools/communication.ts)
The communication tools provide a standardized interface for agents to exchange messages:

send_message: Sends a direct message to another agent
broadcast_message: Sends a message to multiple agents
create_thread: Creates a discussion thread
send_thread_message: Sends a message to a thread
get_messages: Retrieves messages from an agent or thread 4. Agent Registry (services/multi-agent/agent-registry-service.ts)
The agent registry service manages agent registration and discovery:

Registers the current agent with the MCP server
Discovers other agents in the system
Tracks agent status and capabilities
Implements heartbeat mechanism
Cleans up inactive agents 5. Task Delegation (services/multi-agent/task-delegation-service.ts)
The task delegation service manages task assignment and delegation:

Creates tasks with detailed metadata
Assigns tasks to specific agents
Delegates tasks to agents via messages
Tracks task status and completion
Handles task results 6. Multi-Agent Coordination (services/multi-agent/multi-agent-coordination-service.ts)
The multi-agent coordination service provides a unified interface for agent coordination:

Integrates agent registry, task delegation, and notification services
Provides high-level methods for agent coordination
Handles message processing and routing
Manages agent discovery and task assignment
Message Flow
The message flow in the cross-agent server follows these steps:

Agent Registration:
Agent connects to the WebSocket server
Agent sends an "identify" message with its ID, type, and capabilities
Server registers the agent and adds it to the client registry
Server broadcasts agent registration to other agents
Message Sending:
Agent calls the send_message tool with recipient ID and content
Tool forwards the message to the WebSocket server
Server routes the message to the recipient agent
Server sends delivery confirmation to the sender
Task Delegation:
Agent creates a task with title, description, and parameters
Agent assigns the task to another agent
Agent delegates the task via a message
Recipient agent receives the task and processes it
Recipient agent sends task result back to the sender
Integration with MCP
The cross-agent server integrates with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) in several ways:

MCP Server Integration:
The cross-agent server can be integrated with an MCP server
MCP tools can be registered for agent communication and coordination
MCP resources can be used for sharing data between agents
Tool Registration:
Communication tools are registered with the MCP server
Task delegation tools are registered with the MCP server
Agent registry tools are registered with the MCP server
Client Integration:
Agents connect to the MCP server as clients
Agents use MCP tools for communication and coordination
Agents access MCP resources for shared data
Redis and NATS Integration
The system leverages Redis and NATS for enhanced functionality:

Redis for State:
Agent registrations are stored in Redis
Task status is stored in Redis
Capability registry is stored in Redis
NATS for Messaging:
Agent registration events are published to NATS
Agent messages are published to NATS
Task events are published to NATS
WebSocket Implementation
The WebSocket implementation is a key component of the system:

Server Implementation:
WebSocketServer is created on a specified port
Server handles client connections and messages
Server routes messages between clients
Server maintains client registry
Client Implementation:
WebSocketClient connects to the server
Client sends and receives messages
Client handles reconnection logic
Client maintains agent identity
Message Handling:
Messages are JSON-encoded
Messages include type, sender, recipient, and content
Server routes messages based on recipient ID
Server handles delivery confirmations and failures
Task Delegation Workflow
The task delegation workflow is sophisticated:

Task Creation:
Task is created with title, description, and parameters
Task is assigned a unique ID
Task is stored in the task registry
Agent Selection:
Agent is selected based on capabilities and availability
Agent is checked for online status
Agent is assigned to the task
Task Delegation:
Task is sent to the agent via a message
Task includes all necessary parameters
Task status is updated to IN_PROGRESS
Task Execution:
Agent receives the task and processes it
Agent updates task status as it progresses
Agent sends task result when complete
Result Processing:
Task result is received and processed
Task status is updated to COMPLETED or FAILED
Task result is stored and made available
Conclusion
The cross-agent server in the AGSLAG repository implements a sophisticated hub-and-spoke model for agent communication and coordination. It provides a robust foundation for building multi-agent systems with standardized communication protocols, task delegation workflows, and agent discovery mechanisms.

The implementation leverages WebSocket for real-time communication, Redis for state management, and NATS for high-throughput messaging. It integrates with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for tool and resource sharing, enabling agents to collaborate effectively on complex tasks.

This architecture enables the creation of complex multi-agent workflows, where agents can discover each other, exchange messages, delegate tasks, and share results in a standardized and efficient manner.
