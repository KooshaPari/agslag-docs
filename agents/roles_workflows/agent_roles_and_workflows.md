## Introduction

This document details the organizational structure, specialized agent roles, team interactions, lifecycles, core workflows, and collaboration methodologies employed within the AGSLAG AI-powered digital product development platform. It aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how the multi-agent system is structured and operates, mimicking effective human team structures while leveraging AI capabilities.

This document integrates and supersedes the previous `organizational_structure.md`. It complements the [`project_management_framework.md`](./project_management_framework.md) and [`team_coordination_protocols.md`](./team_coordination_protocols.md).

## 1. Overall Organizational Philosophy

*   **Goal:** To foster efficient collaboration between specialized AI agents, mimicking effective human team structures while leveraging AI capabilities like speed, parallel processing, and specialized knowledge access.
*   **Structure:** A flexible, potentially dynamic structure composed of core teams, specialized units, and individual roles coordinated by leadership agents. Team composition can adapt based on project phase and required skills.
*   **Methodology:** Primarily Agile-inspired, emphasizing iterative development, rapid feedback loops (agent-to-agent, agent-to-system, agent-to-human), clear communication protocols (via MCP), and adaptability to changing requirements or environmental factors.
    *   **Scrum Adaptation:** If Scrum is used, "sprints" might represent focused work periods. "Daily Stand-ups" could be automated status reports aggregated by the Lead Agent. "Sprint Reviews" might involve automated testing results and deliverable checks against acceptance criteria. "Retrospectives" could involve analyzing performance metrics, communication logs, and task completion data to identify process bottlenecks or areas for prompt/tool improvement.
    *   **Kanban Adaptation:** If Kanban is used, focus would be on visualizing workflow (potentially via a shared digital board updated via MCP tools), limiting work-in-progress (WIP) per agent or team, and managing flow. Lead agents monitor cycle times and identify bottlenecks. Task statuses defined in `project_management_framework.md` align well with Kanban columns.

## 6. Collaborative Scenario Example: New Feature Implementation

Illustrating role interaction for "Add User Profile Picture Upload":

1.  **Product Manager Agent:** Defines the user story (`TASK-FEAT-025`) and acceptance criteria, prioritizes it in the backlog.
2.  **UI/UX Design Agent:** Receives `TASK-FEAT-025` context from Product. Designs the UI elements (upload button, preview area, cropping tool if needed), updates the design system, and provides specs/prototypes. Creates related design task `TASK-UI-015`.
3.  **Lead Agent (Dev):** Assigns implementation tasks based on the feature and design:
    *   `TASK-BE-010` (Create API endpoint for upload/storage) to Backend Agent.
    *   `TASK-FE-020` (Implement UI components and API integration) to Frontend Agent.
4.  **Backend Agent:** Develops the API endpoint (`/api/v1/users/me/avatar`), including image validation, storage logic (e.g., S3 bucket), and database updates. Writes API tests. Communicates API contract (request/response format) to Frontend Agent. Updates `TASK-BE-010` status.
5.  **Frontend Agent:** Takes UI specs (`TASK-UI-015`) and API contract (`TASK-BE-010`). Implements the React components, handles file selection, interacts with the backend API, displays previews/errors. Writes component tests. Updates `TASK-FE-020` status. Might request clarification from UI/UX on specific interaction details or from Backend on API responses.
6.  **QA Agent:** Reviews the user story and acceptance criteria. Develops test cases (`TASK-QA-030`), executes tests, reports bugs (e.g., `TASK-BUG-101`, `TASK-BUG-102`) linked back to `TASK-FEAT-025`.
7.  **Frontend/Backend Agents:** Address reported bugs (`TASK-BUG-101`, `TASK-BUG-102`), updating status and submitting for re-review/verification by QA.
8.  **DevOps Agent (if involved):** Ensures the deployment pipeline handles the new endpoint and any infrastructure changes (like S3 bucket permissions) correctly. Monitors deployment.
9.  **Documentation Agent:** Updates API documentation for the new endpoint and potentially updates user guides with instructions on how to upload a profile picture. Creates `TASK-DOC-007`.
10. **Lead Agent (Dev):** Oversees the process, resolves blockers (e.g., conflicting API requirements), reviews PRs, and confirms final merge/deployment. Marks `TASK-FEAT-025` as `DONE` once all sub-tasks are complete and verified.

## 7. Post-Production & Maintenance

Maintaining stability and addressing issues post-launch.

### a. Roles & Responsibilities
*   **Maintenance Team/Agents:** Handle bug fixing, minor enhancements, updates.
