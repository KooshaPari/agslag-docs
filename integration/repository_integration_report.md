# Integration Report: Fluujo, OpenManus, and Manus-Open

## 1. Executive Summary

This report analyzes the newly pushed Git repositories (Fluujo, OpenManus, and manus-open) and provides a detailed plan for incorporating them into the AGSLAG MCP Integration system. Each repository offers unique capabilities that can enhance our multi-agent orchestration platform:

- **Fluujo**: A workflow orchestration platform that bridges MCP, AI tools, and visual flow building
- **OpenManus**: An open-source implementation of the Manus AI agent with multi-agent capabilities
- **manus-open**: A containerized sandbox environment for AI agents to interact with terminal and web browsers

By integrating these repositories, we can significantly enhance AGSLAG's capabilities in workflow orchestration, autonomous task execution, and web/terminal interaction.

- Team-based approach with different agent roles (coordinator, planner, researcher, coder, browser, reporter)

**Integration Value:**
OpenManus can enhance AGSLAG's multi-agent capabilities, particularly for autonomous task execution and web-based research.

### 2.3 manus-open

**Overview:**
Manus Sandbox provides a containerized environment that enables AI agents to interact with terminal environments and web browsers programmatically.

**Key Features:**
- Terminal interaction via WebSockets
- Browser automation using Playwright
- File operations (upload, download, etc.)
- Text editor operations

**Technical Architecture:**
- Container-based environment using Docker
- Reconstructed from bytecode with Claude 3.7's help
- Includes modified browser-use library
- Exposes API endpoints for various operations

**Integration Value:**
manus-open can provide AGSLAG with enhanced capabilities for terminal and web browser interaction, enabling more complex agent tasks.

## 3. Integration Strategy

### 3.1 Overall Approach

We'll use the existing AGSLAG MCP Integration architecture as the foundation and extend it to incorporate the new repositories. The integration will follow these principles:

1. **Adapter Pattern**: Create new adapters for each repository
2. **Service Integration**: Expose repository capabilities as services
3. **Workflow Enhancement**: Extend existing workflows with new capabilities
4. **Configuration Management**: Unify configuration across all components
