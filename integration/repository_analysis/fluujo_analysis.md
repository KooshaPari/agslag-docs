# Fluujo Repository Analysis

## Overview

Fluujo is an open-source platform that bridges workflow orchestration, Model-Context-Protocol (MCP), and AI tool integration. It provides a unified interface for managing AI models, MCP servers, and complex workflows - all locally and open-source.

## Key Features

### Environment & API Key Management
- Secure storage and management of API keys
- Environment variable management for different contexts
- Automatic encryption of sensitive data

### Visual Flow Builder
- Create and design complex workflows
- Connect different nodes with edges
- Configure node properties and behavior

### Model Integration
- Connect different AI models in workflows
- Configure model parameters
- Manage model interactions

### Tool Management
- Allow or restrict specific tools for each model
- Configure tool parameters
- Monitor tool usage

### Prompt Design
- Configure system prompts at multiple levels (Model, Flow, Node)
- Create reusable prompt templates
- Manage prompt variables

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- Built with Next.js
- Uses React Flow for visual flow building
- Implements shadcn/ui components for UI

### Backend
- Node.js-based server
- Express API endpoints
- WebSocket support for real-time updates

### MCP Integration
- Supports both stdio and WebSocket transports
- Manages MCP server configurations
- Handles tool approvals and rejections

### Storage
- Local file-based storage
- Encryption for sensitive data
- Backup and restore functionality

## API Endpoints

### Flow API
- `GET /api/flow?action=listFlows`: Lists all flows
- `GET /api/flow?action=getFlow&id={flowId}`: Gets a specific flow
- `POST /api/flow`: Performs various flow operations

### MCP API
- `GET /api/mcp?action=listServers`: Lists all MCP servers
- `POST /api/mcp/connection`: Connects to an MCP server
- `POST /api/mcp/disconnect`: Disconnects from an MCP server

### Environment Variables API
- `GET /api/env`: Gets environment variables
- `POST /api/env`: Sets environment variables
- `DELETE /api/env`: Deletes environment variables

## Integration Points

### MCP Server Integration
Fluujo provides a robust framework for integrating with MCP servers:

```typescript
// src/backend/services/mcp/index.ts
async function connectServer(serverName: string): Promise<MCPServiceResponse> {
  // Look up the configuration directly from storage
  const existingConfig = await this.getServerConfig(serverName);
  if (!existingConfig) {
    return {
      success: false,
      error: `Server configuration for "${serverName}" not found.`
    };
  }
  
  // Connect to the server
  // ...
}
```

### Flow Execution
Fluujo executes flows by processing nodes in sequence based on their connections:

```typescript
// src/backend/execution/flow/index.ts
async function executeFlow(flowId: string, input?: any): Promise<ExecutionResult> {
  // Get the flow
  const flow = await this.getFlow(flowId);
  
  // Find the start node
  const startNode = flow.nodes.find(node => node.type === 'start');
  
  // Execute the flow starting from the start node
  // ...
}
```

### MCP Node Execution
Fluujo executes MCP nodes by connecting to the specified MCP server and executing the configured tools:

```typescript
// src/backend/execution/flow/nodes/MCPNode.ts
async function execCore(node: FlowNode, context: ExecutionContext): Promise<MCPNodeExecResult> {
  // Prepare the MCP execution
  const prepResult = await this.prepareMCPExecution(node, context);
  
  // Execute MCP node using MCPHandler
  const result = await MCPHandler.executeMCP({
    mcpServer: prepResult.mcpServer,
    enabledTools: prepResult.enabledTools,
    mcpEnv: prepResult.mcpEnv
  });
  
  // ...
}
```

## Integration Strategy

To integrate Fluujo into the AGSLAG MCP Integration system, we'll need to:

1. **Create a Flow Orchestration Interface**: Define an interface that represents the flow orchestration capabilities we want to expose from Fluujo.

2. **Implement a Fluujo Adapter**: Create an adapter that implements the Flow Orchestration interface using Fluujo's API.

3. **Extend AGSLAG MCP Integration**: Update the AGSLAG MCP Integration class to include the Fluujo adapter and expose flow orchestration methods.

4. **Create Configuration Management**: Implement configuration management for Fluujo integration.

5. **Develop Example Usage**: Create examples that demonstrate how to use the Fluujo integration.

## Potential Challenges

1. **API Compatibility**: Ensuring that the Fluujo API endpoints match the ones used in the adapter.

2. **WebSocket Support**: Implementing WebSocket support for real-time updates.

3. **Error Handling**: Managing errors that may occur during flow execution.

4. **Configuration Management**: Securely managing API keys and other sensitive configuration.

5. **Performance**: Ensuring that flow execution performs well with complex workflows.

## Conclusion

Fluujo provides a powerful platform for workflow orchestration and MCP integration. By integrating Fluujo into the AGSLAG MCP Integration system, we can enhance AGSLAG's capabilities for visual workflow design, model integration, and tool management.

The integration will require careful implementation of the adapter pattern and configuration management, but the result will be a more powerful and flexible system for multi-agent orchestration.
