# Kiln-AI/Kiln Integration with Jarvis MCP Platform

---

## Overview

Kiln is an open-source platform for:

- Fine-tuning LLMs (Llama, GPT-4o, etc.)
- Synthetic data generation
- Dataset collaboration
- Model evaluation

---

## Integration Plan

- Wrap Kiln's REST API or Python SDK as MCP tools:
  - `kiln_list_datasets`
  - `kiln_create_dataset`
  - `kiln_generate_synthetic_data`
  - `kiln_fine_tune_model`
  - `kiln_evaluate_model`
  - `kiln_export_model`
- Expose these tools via an MCP server.
- Register the server in your `config.json`.
- Allow both users and LLM agents to automate dataset management, fine-tuning, evaluation, and deployment.
- This enables continuous, automated model improvement and collaboration within Jarvis.

---

## Benefits

- **No-code fine-tuning** accessible via MCP.
- **Automated dataset curation** and synthetic data generation.
- **Continuous improvement**: agents can trigger re-training based on feedback.
- **Collaboration**: datasets can be curated by humans, then used by agents.
- **Model deployment**: integrate with existing Ollama/LiteLLM deployment tools.

---

## Workflow Example

1. User or agent calls `kiln_create_dataset` or `kiln_generate_synthetic_data`.
2. User or agent calls `kiln_fine_tune_model` with the dataset.
3. User or agent calls `kiln_evaluate_model` to assess quality.
4. User or agent calls `kiln_export_model` to deploy the model.
5. Jarvis updates its model registry and uses the new model.

## Next Steps

- Implement the MCP server wrapping Kiln's API.
- Register it in `config.json`.
- Add UI or CLI commands to trigger these tools.
- Optionally, add agent prompts to use these tools autonomously.
