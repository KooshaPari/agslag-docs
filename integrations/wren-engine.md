# Wren Engine

## Overview
The Wren Engine is a Python/Rust MCP server acting as a semantic engine for databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Snowflake, etc.). Allows agents to query data based on business logic defined in MDL (Modeling Definition Language), providing context-aware access.

## Potential Utility
Enables agents to interact with enterprise data using business terms rather than raw SQL, improving accuracy and relevance for complex data tasks.
