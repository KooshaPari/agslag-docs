# Testing Strategy

## Test Levels

### Unit Tests
- Individual MCP function testing
- Integration pattern validation
- Error handling verification
- Data structure validation

### Integration Tests
- Cross-MCP workflow testing
- End-to-end scenario validation
- Performance benchmarking
- Error recovery testing

### Acceptance Tests
Following the format from documentation:

```
Given a complex research workflow
When multiple MCPs are involved
Then the system should coordinate their execution and aggregate results

Given a system failure during workflow execution
When an MCP becomes unavailable
Then the system should gracefully handle the error and attempt recovery
```

## Test Automation
- Jest for unit testing
- Cypress for integration testing
- Custom test runners for MCP-specific scenarios
