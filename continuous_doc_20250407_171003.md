## Step: Monitoring Open Documentation Files

---

## Context Update

New files have been opened in the editor, indicating a potential focus on documentation and architecture:

- `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `old-frontend/DOCUMENTATION.md`

---

## Initial Observations

- **ARCHITECTURE.md:**  
  Likely contains high-level system architecture details, design decisions, component interactions, or deployment diagrams.

- **old-frontend/DOCUMENTATION.md:**  
  Presumably contains documentation specific to the legacy or previous frontend implementation, including usage instructions, component descriptions, or migration notes.

## Next Actions

- Await explicit user instructions to:
  - Analyze the contents of these documentation files
  - Summarize or refactor them
  - Extend or update their content
  - Or perform other development or documentation tasks
- Upon receiving instructions, generate a new timestamped documentation file capturing:
  - The task description
  - Initial analysis of the relevant files
  - Planned approach
  - Step-by-step execution with detailed commentary
