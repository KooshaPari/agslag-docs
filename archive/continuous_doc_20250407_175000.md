# Report: ACI.dev MCP Servers - Overview and Types

**Timestamp:** 2025-04-07 17:50:00 PDT

## Overview

ACI.dev provides two types of **Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers** to enable tool-augmented LLM workflows.

---

## Types of MCP Servers

### 1. Apps MCP Server

- Exposes functions (tools) from **specific apps** (e.g., Gmail, GitHub).
- Can include **multiple apps** in a single server.
- Similar to traditional MCP servers.
- Suitable for **curated, controlled tool access**.

### 2. Unified MCP Server

- Provides **two meta functions**:
  - **Discover** any function/tool on the ACI platform.
  - **Execute** any function/tool dynamically.
- Enables **dynamic, flexible tool use**.
- Ideal for **multi-agent orchestration** and **dynamic workflows**.

---

## Relevance to Our Project

- Can choose between:
  - **Static, app-specific** tool access (Apps MCP Server).
  - **Dynamic, flexible** tool discovery and execution (Unified MCP Server).
- Unified server supports **adaptive, multi-agent workflows**.
- Apps server allows **controlled, secure access** to specific tools.
- Both can be integrated into MCP pipelines to **augment LLM capabilities**.

---

## Next Steps

- Decide which MCP server type fits each use case.
- Integrate MCP servers into LLM orchestration workflows.
- Leverage tool-augmented reasoning for complex tasks.
