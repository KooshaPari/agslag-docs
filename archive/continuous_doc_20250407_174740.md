## Overview

This is the **official implementation** of the paper:

**"InfLLM: Unveiling the Intrinsic Capacity of LLMs for Understanding Extremely Long Sequences with Training-Free Memory"**

---

## Key Features

- **Training-free** extension of LLM context window to **up to 1 million tokens**.
- Adds **external memory units** with efficient retrieval.
- Supports **Mistral-7B**, **LLaMA 3**, and other HuggingFace models.
- No fine-tuning or retraining required.
- Efficient inference:
  - Low GPU memory usage.
  - Multi-stage flash attention acceleration.
  - FAISS-based top-k retrieval.
- Configurable via YAML files.
- MIT licensed, actively maintained.

---

## Usage

- Plug-and-play with existing LLMs.
- Configure memory, retrieval, and attention parameters.
- Supports various caching and retrieval strategies (LRU, FIFO, LRU-S).
- Designed for **streaming inputs** and **long-context reasoning**.

---

## Relevance to Our Project

- Provides a **ready-to-integrate** solution for **scalable long-context LLM inference**.
- Can be incorporated into MCP server pipelines to:
  - Enable **multi-document reasoning**.
  - Support **long conversations** or **multi-agent dialogues**.
  - Process **large codebases or documents** efficiently.
- Complements other context extension methods (e.g., SelfExtend).
- Avoids costly fine-tuning or retraining.

---

## Next Steps

- Clone and test the InfLLM repo.
- Integrate with our LLM orchestration stack.
- Experiment with different memory and retrieval configurations.
- Evaluate impact on multi-agent workflows and long-context tasks.
