# MCP Multi-Agent Organizational Structure & Processes

This document details the organizational structure, team roles, lifecycles, and collaboration methodologies employed within the MCP multi-agent development environment. It complements the `project_management_framework.md` and `team_coordination_protocols.md`.

## 1. Overall Organizational Philosophy

*   **Goal:** To foster efficient collaboration between specialized AI agents, mimicking effective human team structures while leveraging AI capabilities like speed, parallel processing, and specialized knowledge access.
*   **Structure:** A flexible, potentially dynamic structure composed of core teams, specialized units, and individual roles coordinated by leadership agents. Team composition can adapt based on project phase and required skills.
*   **Methodology:** Primarily Agile-inspired, emphasizing iterative development, rapid feedback loops (agent-to-agent, agent-to-system, agent-to-human), clear communication protocols, and adaptability to changing requirements or environmental factors.
    *   **Scrum Adaptation:** If Scrum is used, "sprints" might represent focused work periods. "Daily Stand-ups" could be automated status reports aggregated by the Lead Agent. "Sprint Reviews" might involve automated testing results and deliverable checks against acceptance criteria. "Retrospectives" could involve analyzing performance metrics, communication logs, and task completion data to identify process bottlenecks or areas for prompt/tool improvement.
    *   **Kanban Adaptation:** If Kanban is used, focus would be on visualizing workflow (potentially via a shared digital board updated via MCP tools), limiting work-in-progress (WIP) per agent or team, and managing flow. Lead agents monitor cycle times and identify bottlenecks. Task statuses defined in `project_management_framework.md` align well with Kanban columns.

### Collaborative Scenario Example: New Feature Implementation

Let's illustrate how these roles interact for a hypothetical feature, "Add User Profile Picture Upload":

1.  **Product Manager Agent:** Defines the user story ("As a user, I want to upload a profile picture so I can personalize my account"), acceptance criteria (formats allowed, size limits, display location), and prioritizes it in the backlog. Creates `TASK-FEAT-025`.
2.  **UI/UX Design Agent:** Receives `TASK-FEAT-025` context from Product. Designs the UI elements (upload button, preview area, cropping tool if needed), updates the design system, and provides specs/prototypes. Creates related design task `TASK-UI-015`.
3.  **Lead Agent (Dev):** Assigns implementation tasks based on the feature and design:
    *   `TASK-BE-010` (Create API endpoint for upload/storage) to Backend Agent.
    *   `TASK-FE-020` (Implement UI components and API integration) to Frontend Agent.
4.  **Backend Agent:** Develops the API endpoint (`/api/v1/users/me/avatar`), including image validation, storage logic (e.g., S3 bucket), and database updates. Writes API tests. Communicates API contract (request/response format) to Frontend Agent. Updates `TASK-BE-010` status.
5.  **Frontend Agent:** Takes UI specs (`TASK-UI-015`) and API contract (`TASK-BE-010`). Implements the React components, handles file selection, interacts with the backend API, displays previews/errors. Writes component tests. Updates `TASK-FE-020` status. Might request clarification from UI/UX on specific interaction details or from Backend on API responses.
6.  **QA Agent:** Reviews the user story and acceptance criteria. Develops test cases covering successful uploads, invalid file types, size limits, error handling, and UI display. Creates `TASK-QA-030`. Once Frontend/Backend tasks are `NEEDS_REVIEW` or deployed to a test environment, QA Agent executes tests, reports bugs (e.g., `TASK-BUG-101`, `TASK-BUG-102`) linked back to `TASK-FEAT-025`.
7.  **Frontend/Backend Agents:** Address reported bugs (`TASK-BUG-101`, `TASK-BUG-102`), updating status and submitting for re-review/verification by QA.
8.  **DevOps Agent (if involved):** Ensures the deployment pipeline handles the new endpoint and any infrastructure changes (like S3 bucket permissions) correctly. Monitors deployment.
9.  **Documentation Agent:** Updates API documentation for the new endpoint and potentially updates user guides with instructions on how to upload a profile picture. Creates `TASK-DOC-007`.
10. **Lead Agent (Dev):** Oversees the process, resolves blockers (e.g., conflicting API requirements), reviews PRs, and confirms final merge/deployment. Updates `TASK-FEAT-025` to `DONE` once all sub-tasks are complete and verified.

## 6. Post-Production & Maintenance

The product lifecycle extends beyond the initial deployment. Maintaining stability, addressing issues, and managing updates are critical ongoing activities.

### a. Roles & Responsibilities
*   **Maintenance Team/Agents:** Could be the original development team or a dedicated maintenance team/rotation of agents. Responsibilities include bug fixing, minor enhancements, and managing update deployments.
*   **Monitoring Agent(s):** Specialized agents (or DevOps agents) responsible for observing application health, performance, and error rates using monitoring tools (e.g., Sentry via MCP, Datadog). They identify and report anomalies or critical issues.
*   **Support Agent(s) (Optional):** Agents designed to handle incoming user reports (bugs, questions). They triage issues, provide first-level support (e.g., referencing documentation), and escalate technical problems to the maintenance team with relevant details.
*   **Lead Agent Oversight:** A lead agent oversees the maintenance process, prioritizes bug fixes, coordinates updates, and ensures service level agreements (SLAs) are met (if applicable).

### b. Processes
*   **Issue Tracking:** Bugs and user-reported issues are tracked in a dedicated system (could be the same task management system or a specialized bug tracker). Issues should be prioritized based on severity and impact.
*   **Bug Fixing:**
    1.  Issue reported (by monitoring, QA, or support agents).
    2.  Issue triaged and prioritized by the Lead/Maintenance team.
    3.  Assigned to a Maintenance Agent. Status: `ASSIGNED` (or similar).
    4.  Agent investigates, develops fix, tests locally. Status: `IN_PROGRESS`.
    5.  Code submitted for review (following code review protocols). Status: `NEEDS_REVIEW`.
    6.  Fix approved and merged. Status: `FIXED`/`RESOLVED`.
    7.  Fix deployed in the next maintenance release or as a hotfix.

        end
    ```

*   **Monitoring & Alerting:**
    *   **Continuous Observation:** Monitoring agents (or DevOps agents with monitoring duties) continuously observe key system metrics (e.g., CPU/memory usage, error rates, API latency, queue lengths) using configured tools (e.g., Datadog, Prometheus, Sentry via MCP).
    *   **Alert Configuration:** Alerts are pre-configured for critical thresholds or specific error patterns (e.g., >5% 5xx errors in 5 mins, queue depth > 1000, specific exception types).
    *   **Alert Trigger & Notification:** When a threshold is breached, an alert is triggered. The monitoring system notifies the designated on-call agent(s) (Monitoring, DevOps, or Maintenance) via the primary communication channel, potentially tagging the message with severity (e.g., P1, P2).
    *   **Initial Triage:** The notified agent acknowledges the alert and performs initial triage:
        *   Is it a known issue or transient glitch?
        *   What is the immediate impact (e.g., service down, degraded performance, specific feature affected)?
        *   Use tools (e.g., `sentry.get_sentry_issue`) to gather context like stack traces, affected users, frequency.
    *   **Escalation/Resolution:**
        *   If minor/transient, the agent may observe or apply a known quick fix and document the event.
        *   If significant, the agent attempts to stabilize the system (e.g., restart service, scale resources) if safe and appropriate.
        *   An issue ticket is created in the Issue Tracking System, linking relevant alert data and logs.
        *   The issue is escalated to the appropriate Maintenance or Development agent/team for deeper investigation and permanent fix, following the Bug Fixing process.
    *   **Communication:** Updates on the alert status (Investigating, Stabilized, Escalated, Resolved) are communicated back through the primary channel and documented in the issue ticket.
*   **Updates & Patching:** Regular maintenance releases bundle bug fixes and minor improvements. Security patches for dependencies are applied promptly based on vulnerability assessments. DevOps agents manage the deployment process, potentially using automated CI/CD pipelines with rollback capabilities.
*   **User Support Workflow (if applicable):**
    1.  User report received by Support Agent.
    2.  Support Agent attempts resolution using knowledge base/documentation.
    3.  If unresolved, Support Agent gathers details and creates a formal issue ticket for the Maintenance team.
    4.  Support Agent tracks the issue and informs the user (or reporting system) of progress/resolution.

                 SupportAgent-->>User: Inform User of Resolution
            end
        end
    ```

*   **Knowledge Management:** Lessons learned from incidents and bug fixes should be documented (e.g., in a knowledge base, `memorymesh`) to improve future responses and potentially update core documentation. Support agents should contribute findings from user interactions back into the knowledge base.
