# MCP Integration Architecture

## Overview
This document details the architecture for integrating multiple MCPs (manus-mcp, serena, wcgw, and memorymesh) into a cohesive system.

## Core Components

### 1. Integration Patterns
- Type-safe interfaces for MCP integration
- Standardized workflow definitions
- Error handling protocols
- Cross-MCP communication patterns

### 2. Workflow Engine
- Step-by-step execution
- Validation at each step
- Error recovery mechanisms
- Result aggregation

### 3. Knowledge Management
- Structured data storage via memorymesh
- Relationship mapping between nodes
- Query optimization patterns
- Metadata management

## Best Practices

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation
- Retry mechanisms
- Error logging and reporting
- Recovery strategies

### Performance Optimization
- Parallel execution where possible
- Caching strategies
- Resource management
- Load balancing
